The urban system faces severe challenges and these are complicated to capture, predict, resolve and deliver. The current study advances an unconventional decision-support framework to integrate the complexities of science, urban sustainability theories, and data science, with a data-intensive science to incorporate grassroots initiatives for a top-down policies. This work will¬†influence¬†the urban data analytics to optimize the designs and solutions to enhance sustainability, efficiency, resilience, equity, and quality of life. This work emphasizes the significant trends of data-driven and model-driven decision support systems. This will help to address and create an optimal solution¬†for¬†multifaceted challenges of an urban setup¬†within the analytical framework. The analytical¬†investigations includes¬†the research about land use prediction, environmental monitoring, transportation modelling, and social equity analysis. The fusion of urban computing, intelligence, and sustainability science is expected to resolve and contribute in shaping resilient, equitable, and future environmentally sensible eco-cities. It examines the emerging trends in the domain of computational urban science and data science approaches for sustainable development being utilized to address urban challenges including resource management, environmental impact, and social equity. The analysis of recent improvements and case studies highlights the potential of data-driven insights with computational models for promoting resilient sustainable urban environments, towards more effective and informed policy-making.

      "Objectives: In 2016, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) established an Interagency Agreement (IAA), the Million Veteran Program-Computational Health Analytics for Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes Now (MVP-CHAMPION) research collaboration. Materials and Methods: Oversight fell under the VA Office of Research Development (VA ORD) and DOE headquarters. An Executive Committee and 2 senior scientific liaisons work with VA and DOE leadership to optimize efforts in the service of shared scientific goals. The program supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including creation of a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes. Cross-cutting methods including natural language processing, image processing, and reusable code were developed. Results: The 79.6 million dollar collaboration has supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes and launched over 10 collaborative scientific projects in health conditions highly prevalent in veterans. A ground-breaking analysis on the Summit and Andes supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) of the genetic underpinnings of over 2000 health conditions across 44 million genetic variants which resulted in the identification of 38 270 independent genetic variants associating with one or more health traits. Of these, over 2000 identified associations were unique to non-European ancestry. Cross-cutting methods have advanced state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) including large language natural language processing and a system biology study focused on opioid addiction awarded the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. The collaboration has completed work in prostate cancer, suicide prevention, and cardiovascular disease, and cross-cutting data science. Predictive models developed in these projects are being tested for application in clinical management. Discussion: Eight new projects were launched in 2023, taking advantage of the momentum generated by the previous collaboration. A major challenge has been limitations in the scope of appropriated funds at DOE which cannot currently be used for health research. Conclusion: Extensive multidisciplinary interactions take time to establish and are essential to continued progress. New funding models for maintaining high-performance computing infrastructure at the ORNL and for supporting continued collaboration by joint VA-DOE research teams are needed. ¬© 2024 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.\n",
      "This paper explores regional planning as an applied field of practice in Africa, where it is observed as a failed project or a flawed endeavour. In theory, regional planning (the practice) is based on regional science (the field of study) from which regional policy and regional development flow. The article advances the argument that Africa did not benefit from regional science in the past due to data scarcity. However, with the advent of big data and the data deluge caused by big data, regional science and regional planning stand to benefit. We argue that with the proliferation of big data, Africa can now tap into its opportunities and correct its ‚Äòugly‚Äô past regarding regional planning. With big data and artificial intelligence (AI)-tools, coupled with skilled and capable people, Africa can effectively mine data and catch up with global trends in urban and regional planning. The study concludes that there is a need to embrace big data and mine data for African regional science and regional planning to be successful. In addition, the African regional planning project was not a failure, but it suffered a stillbirth due to a lack of data and related infrastructure. ¬© 2024 The Authors\n",
      "Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an established control framework, based on the solution of an optimisation problem to determine the (optimal) control action at each discrete-time sample. Accordingly, major theoretical advances have been provided in the literature, such as closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility certificates, for the most diverse kinds of processes descriptions. Nevertheless, identifying good, trustworthy models for complex systems is a task heavily affected by uncertainties. As of this, developing MPC algorithms directly from data has recently received a considerable amount of attention over the last couple of years. In this work, we review the available data-based MPC formulations, which range from reinforcement learning schemes, adaptive controllers, and novel solutions based on behavioural theory and trajectory representations. In particular, we examine the recent research body on this topic, highlighting the main features and capabilities of available algorithms, while also discussing the fundamental connections among approaches and, comparatively, their advantages and limitations. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd\n",
      "Purpose The relationship between the height of the V wave in the central venous pressure (CVP) waveform and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is well known. Their diagnostic ability is unconfirmed. This study explored CVP waveform variations with TR. Methods All patients who underwent preoperative echocardiography and CVP waveform measurements before surgery at our institution were included. Indices were created to capture each feature of the CVP waveform. The median value for each case was obtained and statistically analyzed according to the severity of TR. A deep learning technique, Transformer, was used to handle the complex features of CVP waveforms. Results This study included 436 cases. The values for C wave ‚Äì Y descent, X descent ‚Äì Y descent, and V wave ‚Äì Y descent differed significantly in the Jonckheere‚ÄìTerpstra test (p = 0.0018, 0.027, and 0.077, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for X descent ‚Äì Y descent in two groups, none to moderate TR and severe TR, was 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.68, 0.98]). For Transformer, the accuracy of the validation dataset was 0.97. Conclusions The shape of the CVP waveform varied with the severity of TR in a large dataset. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.\n",
      "In the context of rapid urbanization, accurately identifying the visual factors that influence environmental safety perception is crucial for improving urban transportation environments and enhancing pedestrian safety. With the increase in urban population density and traffic flow, optimizing urban environmental design to elevate residents‚Äô sense of safety has become a key issue in urban planning and management. However, the existing studies face numerous challenges in conducting large-scale quantitative analysis of environmental safety perception in complex scenarios, such as difficulties in data acquisition and limitations in analytical methods. This study addresses these challenges by applying image semantic segmentation and object detection techniques to extract key visual elements from street view images, combined with manual scoring and deep learning methods, to construct a road safety perception dataset. Using a LightGBM model and the SHAP interpretation framework, in this study, we identify the critical visual factors influencing environmental safety perception. An empirical study was conducted in Macau, a modern city where Eastern and Western cultures intersect, and tourism thrives. The findings reveal that: ‚ë† The overall environmental safety perception in the eight parishes and surrounding roads of Macau is relatively high, with significant regional differences in safety perception scores around Macau‚Äôs parish roads; ‚ë° The proportions of buildings, sidewalks, roads, and trees in images are the four primary factors influencing environmental safety perception; ‚ë¢ The proportions and quantities of visual elements interact with each other, and their reasonable distribution helps form clear spatial visibility and creates conducive activity spaces, thereby enhancing the perception of environmental safety. Through empirical analysis, this study uncovers the mechanisms by which visual elements in urban street scenes affect environmental safety perception, providing scientific evidence for urban planning and transportation environment improvement. The research holds theoretical significance and offers practical references for urban design and management, demonstrating broad application value. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.\n",
      "2D magnetotelluric (MT) imaging detects underground structures by measuring electromagnetic fields. This study tackles two issues in the field: traditional methods‚Äô limitations due to insufficient forward modeling data, and the challenge of multiple solutions in complex scenarios. We introduce an enhanced 2D MT imaging approach with a novel self-attention mechanism, involving: 1. Generating diverse geophysical models and responses to increase data variety and volume. 2. Creating a Swin‚ÄìUnet-based 2D MT Imaging network with self-attention for better modeling and relation capture, incorporating a MT sample generator using real data to lessen large-scale supervised training dependence, and refining the loss function for optimal validation. This method also includes eliminating MT background response to boost training efficiency and reduce training time. 3. Applying a transverse electric/transverse magnetic method for comprehensive 2D MT data response. Tests show that our method greatly improves 2D MT imaging‚Äôs accuracy and efficiency, with excellent generalization. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.\n",
      "Defined as the merging of social and environmental sustainability into corporate operations, sustainable entrepreneurship has embraced data science more and more to improve operational effectiveness and decision-making. Using statistics, machine learning, and computer science to uncover insights from challenging datasets, this interdisciplinary method blends the ideas of sustainability with sophisticated data analysis approaches. Our research supports the choice of this issue by stressing the urgent requirement of sophisticated analytical instruments to negotiate the complexity of sustainable business practices. We compare our proposed model against Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This not only shows how better CNN models are for certain uses but also highlights the general possibilities of data science in promoting sustainability in business. Our results highlight the transforming ability of sophisticated machine learning methods in promoting informed, sustainable decision-making and supporting the more general conversation on sustainable business. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Inc.\n",
      "This study introduces a cutting-edge profit health assessment framework that merges signaling theory and agency theory within a data science context, leveraging both financial and nonfinancial indicators to provide a comprehensive, multidimensional evaluation of earnings quality in publicly traded companies. This model transcends conventional earnings management frameworks by focusing on the holistic earnings condition of firms and addressing challenges related to information asymmetry and managerial motives. The empirical analysis utilizes data from small and medium-sized private enterprises listed on China‚Äôs SME Board between 2018 and 2022, employing machine learning algorithms to rigorously validate the model‚Äôs effectiveness. The results reveal that 85.7% of the penalized firms by the China Securities Regulatory Commission from 2018 to 2023 exhibited low levels of profit health. This data science driven analysis deepens the understanding of corporate earnings health for regulators and investors. The proposed framework not only expands the theoretical underpinnings of earnings management but also serves as a novel evaluative tool for stakeholders, paving the way for broader application across diverse markets and sectors and rethinking earnings quality assessment methodologies through a data science lens. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.\n",
      "Data-informed decision making is a critical goal for many community-based public health research initiatives. However, community partners often encounter challenges when interacting with data. The Community-Engaged Data Science (CEDS) model offers a goal-oriented, iterative guide for communities to collaborate with research data scientists through data ambassadors. This study presents a case study of CEDS applied to research on the opioid epidemic in 18 counties in Ohio as part of the HEALing Communities Study (HCS). Data ambassadors provided a pivotal role in empowering community coalitions to translate data into action using key steps of CEDS which included: data landscapes identifying available data in the community; data action plans from logic models based on community data needs and gaps of data; data collection/sharing agreements; and data systems including portals and dashboards. Throughout the CEDS process, data ambassadors emphasized sustainable data workflows, supporting continued data engagement beyond the HCS. The implementation of CEDS in Ohio underscored the importance of relationship building, timing of implementation, understanding communities‚Äô data preferences, and flexibility when working with communities. Researchers should consider implementing CEDS and integrating a data ambassador in community-based research to enhance community data engagement and drive data-informed interventions to improve public health outcomes. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.\n",
      "The Structural Genomics Consortium is an international open science research organization with a focus on accelerating early-stage drug discovery, namely hit discovery and optimization. We, as many others, believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to be a main accelerator in the field. The question is then how to best benefit from recent advances in AI and how to generate, format and disseminate data to enable future breakthroughs in AI-guided drug discovery. We present here the recommendations of a working group composed of experts from both the public and private sectors. Robust data management requires precise ontologies and standardized vocabulary while a centralized database architecture across laboratories facilitates data integration into high-value datasets. Lab automation and opening electronic lab notebooks to data mining push the boundaries of data sharing and data modeling. Important considerations for building robust machine-learning models include transparent and reproducible data processing, choosing the most relevant data representation, defining the right training and test sets, and estimating prediction uncertainty. Beyond data-sharing, cloud-based computing can be harnessed to build and disseminate machine-learning models. Important vectors of acceleration for hit and chemical probe discovery will be (1) the real-time integration of experimental data generation and modeling workflows within design-make-test-analyze (DMTA) cycles openly, and at scale and (2) the adoption of a mindset where data scientists and experimentalists work as a unified team, and where data science is incorporated into the experimental design. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.\n",
      "Background: Health Data Science (HDS) is a novel interdisciplinary field that integrates biological, clinical, and computational sciences with the aim of analysing clinical and biological data through the utilisation of computational methods. Training healthcare specialists who are knowledgeable in both health and data sciences is highly required, important, and challenging. Therefore, it is essential to analyse students‚Äô learning experiences through artificial intelligence techniques in order to provide both teachers and learners with insights about effective learning strategies and to improve existing HDS course designs. Methods: We applied artificial intelligence methods to uncover learning tactics and strategies employed by students in an HDS massive open online course with over 3,000 students enrolled. We also used statistical tests to explore students‚Äô engagement with different resources (such as reading materials and lecture videos) and their level of engagement with various HDS topics. Results: We found that students in HDS employed four learning tactics, such as actively connecting new information to their prior knowledge, taking assessments and practising programming to evaluate their understanding, collaborating with their classmates, and repeating information to memorise. Based on the employed tactics, we also found three types of learning strategies, including low engagement (Surface learners), moderate engagement (Strategic learners), and high engagement (Deep learners), which are in line with well-known educational theories. The results indicate that successful students allocate more time to practical topics, such as projects and discussions, make connections among concepts, and employ peer learning. Conclusions: We applied artificial intelligence techniques to provide new insights into HDS education. Based on the findings, we provide pedagogical suggestions not only for course designers but also for teachers and learners that have the potential to improve the learning experience of HDS students. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.\n",
      "Background: Models for structuring big-data and data-analytics projects typically start with a definition of the project‚Äôs goals and the business value they are expected to create. The literature identifies proper project definition as crucial for a project‚Äôs success, and also recognizes that the translation of business objectives into data-analytic problems is a difficult task. Unfortunately, common project structures, such as CRISP-DM, provide little guidance for this crucial stage when compared to subsequent project stages such as data preparation and modeling. Contribution: This paper contributes structure to the project-definition stage of data-analytic projects by proposing the Data-Analytic Problem Structure (DAPS). The diagrammatic technique facilitates the collaborative development of a consistent and precise definition of a data-analytic problem, and the articulation of how it contributes to the organization‚Äôs goals. In addition, the technique helps to identify important assumptions, and to break down large ambitions in manageable subprojects. Methods: The semi-formal specification technique took other models for problem structuring ‚Äî common in fields such as operations research and business analytics ‚Äî as a point of departure. The proposed technique was applied in 47 real data-analytic projects and refined based on the results, following a design-science approach. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.\n",
      "Instagram is one of the most popular and widely used social network platforms. It is used as a digital tool to connect with other users and also to share information and influence them for marketing and advertising purposes. The influence of popular users is broadly determined by post‚Äôs engagement rate in terms of likes, comments, and shares, and the number of followers as well. An objective and comprehensive measure of popularity is necessary to understand the factors that will help make an influencer marketing campaign more successful and beneficial for business activities. This research work attempts to take various features of an influencer account and Instagram posts dataset and develop a novel model that accurately quantifies and determines the influence of a user on Instagram. The research is based on datasets of top regional Instagram influencers and their posts based on categories signified through hashtags and captions. Our research attempts to develop a model using principal component analysis to quantify influence and using it to rank influencers. In our experiment, the proposed model after experimentation, gave the Instagram username ‚Äúiqbaal.e‚Äù influence score as 874,712.9526, username ‚Äú1nctdream‚Äù as 753,830.5847 and username ‚Äúweareone. exo‚Äù as 668,054.4360. The proposed model ranks were compared with other ranks for Instagram users based on other measures such as follower rank etc. User names ‚Äúhuyitian‚Äù, ‚Äúbintangemon‚Äù and ‚Äúbimopd‚Äù are top social media influencers based on the proposed model for better business advertising and digital marketing outcomes with collected data and experiment context. This proposed approach gives an exploration for the stakeholders to quantify the impact of influencer in social media and demonstrate an innovative approach. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.\n",

      "Background: Economic incentives can improve clinical outcomes among in-care people living with HIV (PLHIV), but evidence is limited for their effectiveness among out-of-care PLHIV or those at risk of disengagement. We propose a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to advance global knowledge about the use of economic incentives to strengthen the continuity of HIV care and accelerate global goals for HIV epidemic control. Methods: The Rudi Kundini, Pamoja Kundini study will evaluate two implementation models of an economic incentive strategy for supporting two groups of PLHIV in Tanzania. Phase 1 of the study consists of a two-arm, cluster randomized trial across 32 health facilities to assess the effectiveness of a home visit plus one-time economic incentive on the proportion of out-of-care PLHIV with viral load suppression (< 1000 copies/ml) 6¬†months after enrollment (n = 640). Phase 2 is an individual 1:1 randomized controlled trial designed to determine the effectiveness of a short-term counseling and economic incentive program offered to in-care PLHIV who are predicted through machine learning to be at risk of disengaging from care on the outcome of viral load suppression at 12¬†months (n = 692). The program includes up to three incentives conditional upon visit attendance coupled with adapted counselling sessions for this population of PLHIV. Consistent with a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study design, phase 3 is a mixed methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to strategy implementation in phases 1 and 2. Results will be used to guide optimization and scale-up of the incentive strategies, if effective, to the larger population of Tanzanian PLHIV who struggle with continuity of HIV care. Discussion: Innovative strategies that recognize the dynamic process of lifelong retention in HIV care are urgently needed. Strategies such as conditional economic incentives are a simple and effective method for improving many health outcomes, including those on the HIV continuum. If coupled with other supportive services such as home visits (phase 1) or with tailored counselling (phase 2), economic incentives have the potential to strengthen engagement among the subpopulation of PLHIV who struggle with retention in care and could help to close the gap towards reaching global ‚Äú95‚Äì95-95‚Äù goals for ending the AIDS epidemic. Trial registration: Phase 1: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05248100, registered 2/21/2022. Phase 2: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05373095, registered 5/13/2022. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.\n",

      "This article examines how claims to predictable borders via data science techniques are crafted in bureaucratic institutions. Through a case study of testing algorithmic systems at a transnational agency, we examine how humanitarian organizations reconcile the risks of predictive technologies with the benefits they claim to receive. Drawing on a content analysis of policy documents and interviews with humanitarian technologists, we identify three organizational strategies to justify working toward predictability: constantly seeking novel variables and data, maintaining ambiguity, and shifting models to adapt to changing circumstances. These strategies, we argue, sustain the claim that a predictable border is possible even when the technical reality of machine learning models does not live up to bureaucratic imaginaries. The so-called success of a predictable border does not solely derive from its technical capacity to estimate human mobility accurately but from creating a semblance of a predictable border inside an organization. ¬© The Author(s) 2023.\n",
      "Purpose: Data science industry is a multidisciplinary field that deals with a large amount of data and derives useful information for taking routine and strategic business decisions. The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between pricing models, engagement models, and firm performance (FP). This study also aims at uncovering the most effective pricing model and engagement model for improving FP. Design/methodology/approach: Indian data scientists were the respondents of the study. A total of 213 responses were carefully chosen. The data were analyzed using structural equations on Statistical Package for Social Sciences-Analysis of Moment Structures (SPSS-AMOS) version 25 software. Findings: The findings of the study suggested the positive and significant impact of pricing models and engagement models on FP. Value-based pricing strategies have the maximum impact on FP. On the other hand, managed services have a higher influence on FP. Originality/value: By developing a multi-faceted framework, this study is a novel contribution to the field of business strategy, especially for the data science industry. ¬© 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.\n",
      "As chemistry expands to more complex and interdisciplinary areas, a new generation of diverse researchers must engage with science and learn effective cross-disciplinary collaboration and communication. To these ends, we designed and implemented In the Mix, a graduate student-led, two-day workshop for undergraduate students promoting collaborative science in the context of energy storage innovations. The interactive workshop was designed for future and emerging researchers to gain hands-on experience with data science, computational chemistry, and electrochemistry techniques that are critical for developing materials for battery technologies. Participants also visited commercial renewable energy facilities to help them connect discovery-based research with industry and broader societal considerations. The workshop content and structure ensured that participants experienced the interrelatedness of the fields and understood the importance of collaborative research to yield scientific advances with real-world applications. An external team evaluated the workshop and participants‚Äô perceptions of their experiences. While our research context was energy storage, the workshop goals and outcomes are applicable to other contexts. Interdisciplinary, experiential workshops are a key avenue to broadening participation in science and research, and the ideas presented here can be readily modified for other scientific contexts and/or incorporated as broader impact activities. ¬© 2024 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.\n"

       "['Urban computing with a data science approaches can play a pivotal role in understaning and analyzing the potential of these methods for strategic, short-term, and sustainable planning. The recent development in urban areas have progressed towards the data-driven smart sustainable approaches to resolve the complexities around urban areas. The urban system faces severe challenges and these are complicated to capture, predict, resolve and deliver. The current study advances an unconventional decision-support framework to integrate the complexities of science, urban sustainability theories, and data science, with a data-intensive science to incorporate grassroots initiatives for a top-down policies. This work will\\xa0influence\\xa0the urban data analytics to optimize the designs and solutions to enhance sustainability, efficiency, resilience, equity, and quality of life. This work emphasizes the significant trends of data-driven and model-driven decision support systems. This will help to address and create an optimal solution\\xa0for\\xa0multifaceted challenges of an urban setup\\xa0within the analytical framework. The analytical\\xa0investigations includes\\xa0the research about land use prediction, environmental monitoring, transportation modelling, and social equity analysis. The fusion of urban computing, intelligence, and sustainability science is expected to resolve and contribute in shaping resilient, equitable, and future environmentally sensible eco-cities. It examines the emerging trends in the domain of computational urban science and data science approaches for sustainable development being utilized to address urban challenges including resource management, environmental impact, and social equity. The analysis of recent improvements and case studies highlights the potential of data-driven insights with computational models for promoting resilient sustainable urban environments, towards more effective and informed policy-making. Thus, this work explores the integration of computational urban science and data science methodologies to advance sustainable development. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.',\n",
       " 'Objectives: In 2016, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) established an Interagency Agreement (IAA), the Million Veteran Program-Computational Health Analytics for Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes Now (MVP-CHAMPION) research collaboration. Materials and Methods: Oversight fell under the VA Office of Research Development (VA ORD) and DOE headquarters. An Executive Committee and 2 senior scientific liaisons work with VA and DOE leadership to optimize efforts in the service of shared scientific goals. The program supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including creation of a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes. Cross-cutting methods including natural language processing, image processing, and reusable code were developed. Results: The 79.6 million dollar collaboration has supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes and launched over 10 collaborative scientific projects in health conditions highly prevalent in veterans. A ground-breaking analysis on the Summit and Andes supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) of the genetic underpinnings of over 2000 health conditions across 44 million genetic variants which resulted in the identification of 38 270 independent genetic variants associating with one or more health traits. Of these, over 2000 identified associations were unique to non-European ancestry. Cross-cutting methods have advanced state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) including large language natural language processing and a system biology study focused on opioid addiction awarded the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. The collaboration has completed work in prostate cancer, suicide prevention, and cardiovascular disease, and cross-cutting data science. Predictive models developed in these projects are being tested for application in clinical management. Discussion: Eight new projects were launched in 2023, taking advantage of the momentum generated by the previous collaboration. A major challenge has been limitations in the scope of appropriated funds at DOE which cannot currently be used for health research. Conclusion: Extensive multidisciplinary interactions take time to establish and are essential to continued progress. New funding models for maintaining high-performance computing infrastructure at the ORNL and for supporting continued collaboration by joint VA-DOE research teams are needed. ¬© 2024 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.',\n",
       " 'This paper explores regional planning as an applied field of practice in Africa, where it is observed as a failed project or a flawed endeavour. In theory, regional planning (the practice) is based on regional science (the field of study) from which regional policy and regional development flow. The article advances the argument that Africa did not benefit from regional science in the past due to data scarcity. However, with the advent of big data and the data deluge caused by big data, regional science and regional planning stand to benefit. We argue that with the proliferation of big data, Africa can now tap into its opportunities and correct its ‚Äòugly‚Äô past regarding regional planning. With big data and artificial intelligence (AI)-tools, coupled with skilled and capable people, Africa can effectively mine data and catch up with global trends in urban and regional planning. The study concludes that there is a need to embrace big data and mine data for African regional science and regional planning to be successful. In addition, the African regional planning project was not a failure, but it suffered a stillbirth due to a lack of data and related infrastructure. ¬© 2024 The Authors',\n",
       " 'Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an established control framework, based on the solution of an optimisation problem to determine the (optimal) control action at each discrete-time sample. Accordingly, major theoretical advances have been provided in the literature, such as closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility certificates, for the most diverse kinds of processes descriptions. Nevertheless, identifying good, trustworthy models for complex systems is a task heavily affected by uncertainties. As of this, developing MPC algorithms directly from data has recently received a considerable amount of attention over the last couple of years. In this work, we review the available data-based MPC formulations, which range from reinforcement learning schemes, adaptive controllers, and novel solutions based on behavioural theory and trajectory representations. In particular, we examine the recent research body on this topic, highlighting the main features and capabilities of available algorithms, while also discussing the fundamental connections among approaches and, comparatively, their advantages and limitations. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Purpose The relationship between the height of the V wave in the central venous pressure (CVP) waveform and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is well known. Their diagnostic ability is unconfirmed. This study explored CVP waveform variations with TR. Methods All patients who underwent preoperative echocardiography and CVP waveform measurements before surgery at our institution were included. Indices were created to capture each feature of the CVP waveform. The median value for each case was obtained and statistically analyzed according to the severity of TR. A deep learning technique, Transformer, was used to handle the complex features of CVP waveforms. Results This study included 436 cases. The values for C wave ‚Äì Y descent, X descent ‚Äì Y descent, and V wave ‚Äì Y descent differed significantly in the Jonckheere‚ÄìTerpstra test (p = 0.0018, 0.027, and 0.077, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for X descent ‚Äì Y descent in two groups, none to moderate TR and severe TR, was 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.68, 0.98]). For Transformer, the accuracy of the validation dataset was 0.97. Conclusions The shape of the CVP waveform varied with the severity of TR in a large dataset. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.',\n",
       " 'In the context of rapid urbanization, accurately identifying the visual factors that influence environmental safety perception is crucial for improving urban transportation environments and enhancing pedestrian safety. With the increase in urban population density and traffic flow, optimizing urban environmental design to elevate residents‚Äô sense of safety has become a key issue in urban planning and management. However, the existing studies face numerous challenges in conducting large-scale quantitative analysis of environmental safety perception in complex scenarios, such as difficulties in data acquisition and limitations in analytical methods. This study addresses these challenges by applying image semantic segmentation and object detection techniques to extract key visual elements from street view images, combined with manual scoring and deep learning methods, to construct a road safety perception dataset. Using a LightGBM model and the SHAP interpretation framework, in this study, we identify the critical visual factors influencing environmental safety perception. An empirical study was conducted in Macau, a modern city where Eastern and Western cultures intersect, and tourism thrives. The findings reveal that: ‚ë† The overall environmental safety perception in the eight parishes and surrounding roads of Macau is relatively high, with significant regional differences in safety perception scores around Macau‚Äôs parish roads; ‚ë° The proportions of buildings, sidewalks, roads, and trees in images are the four primary factors influencing environmental safety perception; ‚ë¢ The proportions and quantities of visual elements interact with each other, and their reasonable distribution helps form clear spatial visibility and creates conducive activity spaces, thereby enhancing the perception of environmental safety. Through empirical analysis, this study uncovers the mechanisms by which visual elements in urban street scenes affect environmental safety perception, providing scientific evidence for urban planning and transportation environment improvement. The research holds theoretical significance and offers practical references for urban design and management, demonstrating broad application value. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.',\n",

However, community partners often encounter challenges when interacting with data. The Community-Engaged Data Science (CEDS) model offers a goal-oriented, iterative guide for communities to collaborate with research data scientists through data ambassadors. This study presents a case study of CEDS applied to research on the opioid epidemic in 18 counties in Ohio as part of the HEALing Communities Study (HCS). Data ambassadors provided a pivotal role in empowering community coalitions to translate data into action using key steps of CEDS which included: data landscapes identifying available data in the community; data action plans from logic models based on community data needs and gaps of data; data collection/sharing agreements; and data systems including portals and dashboards. Throughout the CEDS process, data ambassadors emphasized sustainable data workflows, supporting continued data engagement beyond the HCS. The implementation of CEDS in Ohio underscored the importance of relationship building, timing of implementation, understanding communities‚Äô data preferences, and flexibility when working with communities.

We, as many others, believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to be a main accelerator in the field. The question is then how to best benefit from recent advances in AI and how to generate, format and disseminate data to enable future breakthroughs in AI-guided drug discovery. We present here the recommendations of a working group composed of experts from both the public and private sectors. Robust data management requires precise ontologies and standardized vocabulary while a centralized database architecture across laboratories facilitates data integration into high-value datasets. Lab automation and opening electronic lab notebooks to data mining push the boundaries of data sharing and data modeling. Important considerations for building robust machine-learning models include transparent and reproducible data processing, choosing the most relevant data representation, defining the right training and test sets, and estimating prediction uncertainty. Beyond data-sharing, cloud-based computing can be harnessed to build and disseminate machine-learning models. Important vectors of acceleration for hit and chemical probe discovery will be (1) the real-time integration of experimental data generation and modeling workflows within design-make-test-analyze (DMTA) cycles openly, and at scale and (2) the adoption of a mindset where data scientists and experimentalists work as a unified team, and where data science is incorporated into the experimental design. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.',\n",
       " 'Background: Health Data Science (HDS) is a novel interdisciplinary field that integrates biological, clinical, and computational sciences with the aim of analysing clinical and biological data through the utilisation of computational methods. Training healthcare specialists who are knowledgeable in both health and data sciences is highly required, important, and challenging. Therefore, it is essential to analyse students‚Äô learning experiences through artificial intelligence techniques in order to provide both teachers and learners with insights about effective learning strategies and to improve existing HDS course designs. Methods: We applied artificial intelligence methods to uncover learning tactics and strategies employed by students in an HDS massive open online course with over 3,000 students enrolled. We also used statistical tests to explore students‚Äô engagement with different resources (such as reading materials and lecture videos) and their level of engagement with various HDS topics. Results: We found that students in HDS employed four learning tactics, such as actively connecting new information to their prior knowledge, taking assessments and practising programming to evaluate their understanding, collaborating with their classmates, and repeating information to memorise. Based on the employed tactics, we also found three types of learning strategies, including low engagement (Surface learners), moderate engagement (Strategic learners), and high engagement (Deep learners), which are in line with well-known educational theories. The results indicate that successful students allocate more time to practical topics, such as projects and discussions, make connections among concepts, and employ peer learning. Conclusions: We applied artificial intelligence techniques to provide new insights into HDS education. Based on the findings, we provide pedagogical suggestions not only for course designers but also for teachers and learners that have the potential to improve the learning experience of HDS students. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.',\n",
       " 'Background: Models for structuring big-data and data-analytics projects typically start with a definition of the project‚Äôs goals and the business value they are expected to create. The literature identifies proper project definition as crucial for a project‚Äôs success, and also recognizes that the translation of business objectives into data-analytic problems is a difficult task. Unfortunately, common project structures, such as CRISP-DM, provide little guidance for this crucial stage when compared to subsequent project stages such as data preparation and modeling. Contribution: This paper contributes structure to the project-definition stage of data-analytic projects by proposing the Data-Analytic Problem Structure (DAPS). The diagrammatic technique facilitates the collaborative development of a consistent and precise definition of a data-analytic problem, and the articulation of how it contributes to the organization‚Äôs goals. In addition, the technique helps to identify important assumptions, and to break down large ambitions in manageable subprojects. Methods: The semi-formal specification technique took other models for problem structuring ‚Äî common in fields such as operations research and business analytics ‚Äî as a point of departure.

It is used as a digital tool to connect with other users and also to share information and influence them for marketing and advertising purposes. The influence of popular users is broadly determined by post‚Äôs engagement rate in terms of likes, comments, and shares, and the number of followers as well. An objective and comprehensive measure of popularity is necessary to understand the factors that will help make an influencer marketing campaign more successful and beneficial for business activities. This research work attempts to take various features of an influencer account and Instagram posts dataset and develop a novel model that accurately quantifies and determines the influence of a user on Instagram. The research is based on datasets of top regional Instagram influencers and their posts based on categories signified through hashtags and captions.

       " 'Background: Economic incentives can improve clinical outcomes among in-care people living with HIV (PLHIV), but evidence is limited for their effectiveness among out-of-care PLHIV or those at risk of disengagement. We propose a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to advance global knowledge about the use of economic incentives to strengthen the continuity of HIV care and accelerate global goals for HIV epidemic control. Methods: The Rudi Kundini, Pamoja Kundini study will evaluate two implementation models of an economic incentive strategy for supporting two groups of PLHIV in Tanzania. Phase 1 of the study consists of a two-arm, cluster randomized trial across 32 health facilities to assess the effectiveness of a home visit plus one-time economic incentive on the proportion of out-of-care PLHIV with viral load suppression (< 1000 copies/ml) 6\\xa0months after enrollment (n = 640). Phase 2 is an individual 1:1 randomized controlled trial designed to determine the effectiveness of a short-term counseling and economic incentive program offered to in-care PLHIV who are predicted through machine learning to be at risk of disengaging from care on the outcome of viral load suppression at 12\\xa0months (n = 692). The program includes up to three incentives conditional upon visit attendance coupled with adapted counselling sessions for this population of PLHIV. Consistent with a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study design, phase 3 is a mixed methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to strategy implementation in phases 1 and 2. Results will be used to guide optimization and scale-up of the incentive strategies, if effective, to the larger population of Tanzanian PLHIV who struggle with continuity of HIV care. Discussion: Innovative strategies that recognize the dynamic process of lifelong retention in HIV care are urgently needed. Strategies such as conditional economic incentives are a simple and effective method for improving many health outcomes, including those on the HIV continuum. If coupled with other supportive services such as home visits (phase 1) or with tailored counselling (phase 2), economic incentives have the potential to strengthen engagement among the subpopulation of PLHIV who struggle with retention in care and could help to close the gap towards reaching global ‚Äú95‚Äì95-95‚Äù goals for ending the AIDS epidemic.

Through a case study of testing algorithmic systems at a transnational agency, we examine how humanitarian organizations reconcile the risks of predictive technologies with the benefits they claim to receive. Drawing on a content analysis of policy documents and interviews with humanitarian technologists, we identify three organizational strategies to justify working toward predictability: constantly seeking novel variables and data, maintaining ambiguity, and shifting models to adapt to changing circumstances. These strategies, we argue, sustain the claim that a predictable border is possible even when the technical reality of machine learning models does not live up to bureaucratic imaginaries. The so-called success of a predictable border does not solely derive from its technical capacity to estimate human mobility accurately but from creating a semblance of a predictable border inside an organization. ¬© The Author(s) 2023.',\n",

       " 'Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is a versatile and powerful analytical technique widely used for rapid, in situ elemental analysis across various fields, from industrial quality control to planetary exploration. This review addresses the critical aspects and emerging trends in LIBS, focusing on calibration challenges, integrating complementary techniques (data fusion), and applying data science for spectral analysis. Calibration is a fundamental challenge in LIBS due to matrix effects, signal drift, and variations in experimental conditions. Recent advancements aim to develop matrix-independent calibration models and employ machine learning algorithms to improve calibration accuracy and robustness. LIBS has also proven invaluable in space exploration, particularly on Mars. Instruments like ChemCam and SuperCam have successfully utilized LIBS to perform real-time chemical analysis of the Martian surface, providing critical insights into its composition and history. The review further explores the advancements in multivariate calibration techniques for handling complex and multi-component systems. Techniques such as Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are increasingly employed to address the high dimensionality of LIBS data, enhancing the precision and reliability of the analysis. In addition, combining LIBS with other instrumental analytical techniques expands its analytical capabilities. Data fusion strategies integrating LIBS with techniques like Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and hyperspectral imaging provide a more comprehensive understanding of material composition. These integrated systems, supported by sophisticated data fusion algorithms, offer unprecedented insights and accuracy. Finally, applying data science in LIBS transforms spectral inspection and analysis. Machine learning and deep learning methods are being adopted to automate and enhance the processing and interpretation of LIBS spectra, uncovering complex patterns and improving analysis accuracy. The future lies in leveraging big data analytics and real-time processing to address more complex analytical challenges. In conclusion, LIBS is evolving rapidly, driven by advancements in calibration methods, techniques integration, and data science. This review highlights the potential of LIBS to continue pushing the boundaries of material analysis and its significant contributions to diverse scientific and industrial fields. ¬© 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.',\n",

       " 'Laser ablation is a vital material removal technique, but current methods lack a data-driven approach to assess quality. This study proposes a novel method, employing information entropy, a concept from data science, to evaluate laser ablation quality. By analyzing the randomness associated with the ablation process through the distribution of a probability value (reb), we quantify the uncertainty (entropy) of the ablation. Our research reveals that higher energy levels lead to lower entropy, signifying a more controlled and predictable ablation process. Furthermore, using an interval time closer to the baseline value improves the ablation consistency. Additionally, the analysis suggests that the energy level has a stronger correlation with entropy than the baseline interval time (bit). The entropy decreased by 6.32 from 12.94 at 0.258 mJ to 6.62 at 0.378 mJ, while the change due to the bit was only 2.12 (from 10.84 at bit/2 to 8.72 at bit). This indicates that energy is a more dominant factor for predicting ablation quality. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of information entropy analysis for evaluating laser ablation, paving the way for optimizing laser parameters and achieving a more precise material removal process. ¬© 2024 by the authors.',\n",

However, little is known about how interventions on the exposome, including personal behavioral modification or policy-level interventions, may impact AD/ADRD disease burden at the population level in real-world settings and the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Methods: We performed a critical review to discuss the challenges in modeling exposome interventions on population-level AD/ADRD burden and the potential of using agent-based modeling (ABM) and other advanced data science methods for causal inference to achieve this. Results: We describe how ABM can be used for empirical causal inference modeling and provide a virtual laboratory for simulating the impacts of personal and policy-level interventions. These hypothetical experiments can provide insight into the optimal timing, targeting, and duration of interventions, identifying optimal combinations of interventions, and can be augmented with economic analyses to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions. We also discuss other data science methods, including structural equation modeling and Mendelian randomization. Lastly, we discuss challenges in modeling the complex exposome, including high dimensional and sparse data, the need to account for dynamic changes over time and over the life course, and the role of exposome burden scores developed using item response theory models and artificial intelligence to address these challenges. Conclusions: This critical review highlights opportunities and challenges in modeling exposome interventions on population-level AD/ADRD disease burden while considering the cost-effectiveness of different interventions, which can be used to aid data-driven policy decisions. ¬© 2024 by the authors.',\n",

       " \"Background: The language that children are exposed to in their early years is enhanced by children's picture books. It is important to better characterise this input, and recent research has begun to explore corpora of narrative picture books. However, previous research has been restricted by methodological limitations that make it difficult to develop large datasets. Further, information texts become increasingly important as children progress through school, but little is known about the language of their earliest form, namely, informational picture books. The current study investigates how informational and narrative picture book exposure might change the language environment of children in a way that supports reading development. Methods: The study applies data science methods to build a larger language model than previously possible and investigates the lexical profile of over 2000 narrative and information picture books. Picture book vocabulary is innovatively derived from digital sources of books read-aloud online, which pushes the field forward by providing researchers access to larger pools of data than previously possible. Detailed comparisons of informational and narrative picture books are reported regarding their lexical diversity, density, morphology, academic vocabulary and semantic clusters. Models are developed to estimate the additional word-type exposure a child may encounter in their language environment from narrative and informational picture books. Results: The study demonstrates that information and narrative picture books expose children to substantially different semantic environments. It is demonstrated that information picture books provide extensive exposure to academic vocabulary, providing important input aligned with later reading needs. Further, computational models indicate that book reading once every day or second day over a year might boost unique-word exposure by approximately 10% for some language environments. Conclusions: Combining informational and narrative picture books enhance the language environment of children more than narratives alone, providing more lexical diversity, density and complex morphology. ¬© 2024 The Author(s).

Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing the field of cybersecurity by providing advanced tools and techniques to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats more effectively and efficiently. This paper proposed Ethereum Hashing Hyperbolic Cryptography (EHHC) for cyber security in the data science model. The proposed EHHC model comprises the Hyperbolic Curve Cryptography (HCC) model for data science security. With the integration of the HCC model in the Ethereum blockchain hashing is performed for data science data security. The proposed EHHC model is deployed in the Ethereum blockchain for data security for cyber security. The cyber threats are estimated and classified with the machine learning model for the classification of attacks using the CICIDS, UNSW-NB15 and KDD datasets. Through the incorporation of the EHHC model cyber threats are classified and detected for the different simulation environments. The results demonstrated that the proposed EHHC model achieves a higher classification accuracy of 96.1% with a minimal computation time of ~12% than the conventional cryptographic techniques. The results expressed a higher classification for cyber threat detection and classification in the data science environment. ¬© Little Lion Scientific.',\n",
       " 'Catalysis of multicomponent transformations requires controlled assembly of reactants within the active site. Supramolecular scaffolds possess synthetic microenvironments that enable precise modulation over noncovalent interactions (NCIs) engaged by reactive, encapsulated species. While molecular properties that describe the behavior of single guests in host cavities have been studied extensively, multicomponent transformations remain challenging to design and deploy. Here, simple univariate regression and threshold analyses are employed to model reactivity in a cascade reduction of azaarenes catalyzed by water-soluble metal organic cages. Yield and stereoselectivity models help deduce unknown mechanisms of reactivity by the multicomponent, host-guest complexes. Furthermore, a comprehensive model is established for NCIs driving stereoselectivity in the reported host-guest adducts. ¬© 2024 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.',\n",
       " 'Paralympic wheelchair athletes solely depend on the power of their upper-body for their on- court wheeled mobility as well as for performing sport-specific actions in ball sports, like a basketball shot or a tennis serve. The objective of WheelPower is to improve the power output of athletes in their sport-specific wheelchair to perform better in competition. To achieve this objective the current project systematically combines the three Dutch measurement innovations (WMPM, Esseda wheelchair ergometer, PitchPerfect system) to monitor a large population of athletes from different wheelchair sports resulting in optimal power production by wheelchair athletes during competition. The data will be directly implemented in feedback tools accessible to athletes, trainers and coaches which gives them the unique opportunity to adapt their training and wheelchair settings for optimal performance. Hence, the current consortium facilitates mass and focus by uniting scientists and all major Paralympic wheelchair sports to monitor the power output of many wheelchair athletes under field and lab conditions, which will be assisted by the best data science approach to this challenge. ¬© Riemer J.

       " 'Purpose: There is a need for precollege learning designs that empower youth to be epistemic agents in contexts that intersect burgeoning areas of computing, big data and social media. The purpose of this study is to explore how ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù or open-inquiry data science with social media supports learning. Design/methodology/approach: This paper offers vignettes from an illustrative youth study case that highlights the pedagogical prospects and obstacles tied to designing for open-ended inquiry with computational data science to access or ‚Äúscrape‚Äù Twitter/X. The youth case showcases how social media can be taken up productively and in ways that facilitate epistemological agency, an approach where individuals actively shape understanding and knowledge-creation processes, highlighting the potentially transformative impact this approach might have in empowering learners to engage productively. Findings: The authors identify three key affordances for learning that emerged from the illustrative case: (1) flexible opportunities for content-specific domain mastery, (2) situated inquiry that embodies next-generation science practices and (3) embedded computational skill development. The authors discuss these findings in relation to contemporary education needs to broaden participation in data science and computing. Originality/value: To address challenges in current data science education associated with supporting sustained and productive engagement in computing-based data science, the authors leverage a ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù approach ‚Äì an original pedagogical framework to support open inquiry with precollege groups.

       " 'Balinese saka calendar has a system of good and bad days called Ala Ayuning Dewasa. This system included a variety of activities. One of them is cayenne pepper farming. The farmers in Bali have used the Ala Ayuning Dewasa as a guide in planting because they are believed to coincide with favorable natural conditions. However, there has been no empirical evidence regarding the suitability of the system. This study aims to begin empirical evidence by showing a correlation between this system and optimal air temperature and humidity in growing cayenne pepper. This study uses the formula y = sin(œÄ/105¬∞ x + 90¬∞) as a mathematical model of the Ala Ayuning Dewasa, where the maximum cycle value (y=1) represents a good day and the minimum value (y = -1) indicates a bad day. Correlation was measured against the initial assessment of the accuracy of a day as the beginning of cayenne pepper planting based on temperature and air humidity for three months after (time needed from planting to harvesting). The assessment was carried out using temperature and humidity data from October 1, 2014 to January 1, 2017. The comparison shows that there is no correlation between the two with correlation value of -0.161. However, the results of observations show that there is a similar pattern even with the beginning of a different phase. By revising the beginning of the Ala Ayuning Dewasa calendar by 60 days, the correlation value becomes 0.799. The suggestion from this initial research is to shift the beginning of Ala Ayuning Dewasa planting of cayenne pepper by 60 days to increase the correlation with optimal temperature and humidity conditions for cayenne pepper growth. ¬© 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

       " 'Background: Research on healthcare disparities in pediatric radiology is limited, leading to the persistence of missed care opportunities (MCO). We hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing health disparities in access to pediatric radiology services. Objective: Evaluate the social determinants of health and sociodemographic factors related to pediatric radiology MCO before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: The study examined all outpatient pediatric radiology exams at a pediatric medical center and its affiliate centers from 03/08/19 to 06/07/21 to identify missed care opportunities. Logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis were used to explore factors and visualize relationships between social determinants and missed care opportunities. Results: A total of 62,009 orders were analyzed: 30,567 pre-pandemic, 3,205 pandemic, and 28,237 initial recovery phase. Median age was 11.34\\xa0years (IQR 5.24‚Äì15.02), with 50.8% females (31,513/62,009). MCO increased during the pandemic (1,075/3,205; 33.5%) compared to pre-pandemic (5,235/30,567; 17.1%) and initial recovery phase (4,664/28,237; 16.5%). The CART analysis identified changing predictors of missed care opportunities across different periods. Pre-pandemic, these were driven by exam-specific factors and patient age. During the pandemic, social determinants like income, distance, and ethnicity became key. In the initial recovery phase, the focus returned to exam-specific factors and age, but ethnicity continued to influence missed care, particularly in neurological exams for Hispanic patients. Logistic regression revealed similar results: during the pandemic, increased distance from the examination site (OR 1.1), residing outside the state (OR 1.57), Hispanic (OR 1.45), lower household income ($25,000‚Äì50,000 (OR 3.660) and $50,000‚Äì75,000 (OR 1.866)), orders for infants (OR 1.43), and fluoroscopy (OR 2.3) had higher odds. In the initial recovery phase, factors such as living outside the state (OR 1.19), orders for children (OR 0.79), and being Hispanic (OR 1.15) correlate with higher odds of MCO. Conclusion: The application of basic data science techniques is a valuable tool in uncovering complex relationships between sociodemographic factors and disparities in pediatric radiology, offering crucial insights into addressing inequalities in care.

Personalizing radiotherapy treatments for individual patients, therefore, depends on integrating physical treatment planning with predictive models of tumor control and normal tissue complications. Predictive models could be improved using a wide range of rich data sources, including tumor and normal tissue genomics, radiomics, and dosiomics. Deep learning will drive improvements in classifying normal tissue tolerance, predicting intra-treatment tumor changes, tracking accumulated dose distributions, and quantifying the tumor response to radiotherapy based on imaging.

       " 'Purpose. The purpose of our article is to research and forecast prices for agricultural products using the example of potato prices based on the most effective models using data science techniques. Methodology / approach. Various forecasting models are explored, starting from baseline models like decomposition and exponential smoothing models to more advanced techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, as well as deep learning models including neural network. The data is split into training and testing sets, and models are validated using cross-validation techniques and optimised through hyperparameter tuning. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE. The selected model is then used to generate future price forecasts, with uncertainty quantified through confidence intervals. Results. The study successfully applied advanced data science techniques to forecast potato prices, leveraging a range of effective models. By analysing historical price data and using various forecasting methods, the research identified the most accurate models for predicting future price trends. The results demonstrate that the selected models can provide reliable forecasts. In particular, the results showed that the SARIMA (1,0,0)(0,1,1)[12] model could achieve good forecast results when applied to real problems and, thus, can be effectively used for forecasting tasks especially considering seasonality. In addition, it should be noted that the ETS (M, Ad, A) model has a higher prediction accuracy at the time intervals closest to the original data. The obtained results support using both models simultaneously for forecasting, which can compensate for the shortcomings of each of them. The models can be used separately, to more accurately predict the values for the required period, or a combination of them is also possible. Originality / scientific novelty. The study‚Äôs originality lies in development of methods for effectively accounting for seasonality in agricultural price data, such as using seasonal decomposition techniques or more advanced techniques that combine statistical and data science approaches. The novelty implies the implementation of real-time data processing and forecasting system allows for the timely prediction of price changes, enabling stakeholders to make more informed decisions. Practical value / implications. Forecasting potato prices holds significant practical value for various stakeholders. For farmers, accurate forecasts enable informed decisions on the optimal times to plant, harvest, and sell their crops, thereby optimising their profits. In the supply chain, distributors and retailers can use these forecasts to manage inventory more effectively and plan contracts, reducing waste and avoiding shortages. Policymakers benefit from forecasts by anticipating market fluctuations and stabilising prices, which supports both consumers and producers. For consumers, stable pricing ensures better budgeting and helps avoid sudden price spikes, making essential foods more affordable. Overall, accurate price forecasting enhances market efficiency by reducing uncertainty and aiding investors in managing risk. ¬© 2024, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

High-profile successes deploying AI in domains such as protein folding have highlighted AI‚Äôs potential to unlock new frontiers of scientific knowledge. However, the pathway from AI innovation to deployment in research is not linear. Those seeking to drive a new wave of scientific progress through the application of AI require a diffusion engine that can enhance AI adoption across disciplines. Lessons from previous waves of technology change, experiences of deploying AI in real-world contexts and an emerging research agenda from the AI for science community suggest a framework for accelerating AI adoption. This framework requires action to build supply chains of ideas between disciplines; rapidly transfer technological capabilities through open research; create AI tools that empower researchers; and embed effective data stewardship. Together, these interventions can cultivate an environment of open data science that deliver the benefits of AI across the sciences. ¬© 2024 The Author(s). Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.',\n",

       " 'With the development of digital pedagogical resources, courses, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rise in the use of video-based learning (VBL) and teaching as one of the primary methods of instruction. Additionally, in recent years, bioinformatics has surfaced as an integral discipline in life sciences, where scientists are able to manipulate and analyze large sets of data. As a result, the need for digitally enhanced undergraduate and graduate teaching of basic bioinformatics skill sets of an applied nature has become increasingly high. Here, we designed and implemented a set of video-based bioinformatics tutorials as an open educational resource to be taught in an online synchronous, asynchronous, as well as HyFlex setting. These tutorials were designed to identify a ligand against unknown amino acid and nucleotide sequences to unveil their context in diverse species. This was achieved by navigating online bioinformatic databases, performing multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analyses, protein structure prediction/comparison, and docking. In the end, students also completed a survey questionnaire outlining their experience with the VBL. By the end of the term, VBL enabled the students to learn and apply bioinformatic concepts and tools to predict the protein structure from an unknown sequence and dock it with the ligands. Students rated VBL as one of the most powerful learning mediums out of many used as part of the module. Bioinformatic videos, besides capturing and distributing the bioinformatic information, also provided an invigorating environment where students better learned, understood, and retained the content.

       " 'A Jyotirlinga or Jyotirlingam is a devotional representation of Hindu Deity. The word is made up of Sanskrit \\'jyotis\\' which means \\'radiance\\' and linga, also spelled lingam, which means \\'sign\\' or \"distinguishing symbol\". Hinduism defines Jyotirlingam as the radiant sign of the Almighty. In our data scientific view, nonetheless, Jyotirlinga represents the embodiment of time series. It exhibits stationarity and a multi-model pattern of naturally occurring time series, a classical data science pattern that has a causative relationship with historical events, world macroeconomics, agriculture, and other worldly events. Volume 2 has delved into the significance of six prominent Jyotirlingas - Rameshwaram, Nageshvara, Kashi Vishwanath, Trimbakeshwar, Kedarnath, and Grishneshwar - and explored their spiritual and scientific aspects. Through an interdisciplinary analysis that incorporates a range of fields, from statistics to environmental engineering, from historical perspectives to data science, we have gained invaluable insights into the patterns and trends that shape these sacred symbols. By embracing the fusion of modern science and traditional spiritual practices, we have the potential to unlock new levels of understanding and enlightenment, bridging the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary knowledge. ¬© 2024 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this review, we discuss the importance of grounding Big Data Science in the principles of equity and social justice to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the global HIV response. Recent Findings: Social, ethical, and legal considerations of Big Data Science have been identified in the context of HIV research. However, efforts to mitigate these challenges have been limited. Consequences include disciplinary silos within the field of HIV, a lack of meaningful engagement and ownership with and by communities, and potential misinterpretation or misappropriation of analyses that could further exacerbate health inequities. Summary: Big Data Science can support the HIV response by helping to identify gaps in previously undiscovered or understudied pathways to HIV acquisition and onward transmission, including the consequences for health outcomes and associated comorbidities. However, in the absence of a guiding framework for equity, alongside meaningful collaboration with communities through balanced partnerships, a reliance on big data could continue to reinforce inequities within and across marginalized populations. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.',\n",
       " 'Introduction: Artificial intelligence tools such as the large language models (LLMs) Bard and ChatGPT have generated significant research interest. Utilization of these LLMs to study the epidemiology of a target population could benefit urologists. We investigated whether Bard and ChatGPT can perform a large-scale calculation of the incidence and prevalence of kidney stone disease. Materials and Methods: We obtained reference values from two published studies, which used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database to calculate the prevalence and incidence of kidney stone disease. We then tested the capability of Bard and ChatGPT to perform similar calculations using two different methods. First, we instructed the LLMs to access the data sets and independently perform the calculation. Second, we instructed the interfaces to generate a customized computer code, which could perform the calculation on downloaded data sets. Results: While ChatGPT denied the ability to access and perform calculations on the NHANES database, Bard intermittently claimed the ability to do so. Bard provided either accurate results or inaccurate and inconsistent results. For example, Bard‚Äôs ‚Äò‚Äòcalculations‚Äô‚Äô for the incidence of kidney stones from 2015 to 2018 were 2.1% (95% CI 1.5‚Äì2.7), 1.75% (95% CI 1.6‚Äì1.9), and 0.8% (95% CI 0.7‚Äì0.9), while the published number was 2.1% (95% CI 1.5‚Äì2.7). Bard provided discrete mathematical details of its calculations, however, when prompted further, admitted to having obtained the numbers from online sources, including our chosen reference articles, rather than from a de novo calculation. Both LLMs were able to produce a code (Python) to use on the downloaded NHANES data sets, however, these would not readily execute. Conclusions: ChatGPT and Bard are currently incapable of performing epidemiologic calculations and lack transparency and accountability. Caution should be used, particularly with Bard, as claims of its capabilities were convincingly misleading, and results were inconsistent. ¬© Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.',\n",
       " \"Purpose: To characterize the incidence of kidney failure associated with intravitreal anti-VEGF exposure; and compare the risk of kidney failure in patients treated with ranibizumab, aflibercept, or bevacizumab. Design: Retrospective cohort study across 12 databases in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network. Subjects: Subjects aged ‚â• 18 years with ‚â• 3 monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF medications for a blinding disease (diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, exudative age-related macular degeneration, or retinal vein occlusion). Methods: The standardized incidence proportions and rates of kidney failure while on treatment with anti-VEGF were calculated. For each comparison (e.g., aflibercept versus ranibizumab), patients from each group were matched 1:1 using propensity scores. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of kidney failure while on treatment. A random effects meta-analysis was performed to combine each database's hazard ratio (HR) estimate into a single network-wide estimate. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of kidney failure while on anti-VEGF treatment, and time from cohort entry to kidney failure. Results: Of the 6.1 million patients with blinding diseases, 37 189 who received ranibizumab, 39 447 aflibercept, and 163 611 bevacizumab were included; the total treatment exposure time was 161 724 person-years. The average standardized incidence proportion of kidney failure was 678 per 100 000 persons (range, 0‚Äì2389), and incidence rate 742 per 100 000 person-years (range, 0‚Äì2661). The meta-analysis HR of kidney failure comparing aflibercept with ranibizumab was 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70‚Äì1.47; P = 0.45), ranibizumab with bevacizumab 0.95 (95% CI, 0.68‚Äì1.32; P = 0.62), and aflibercept with bevacizumab 0.95 (95% CI, 0.65‚Äì1.39; P = 0.60). Conclusions: There was no substantially different relative risk of kidney failure between those who received ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept. Practicing ophthalmologists and nephrologists should be aware of the risk of kidney failure among patients receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF medications and that there is little empirical evidence to preferentially choose among the specific intravitreal anti-VEGF agents.

       " 'Cardiovascular diseases are causing more deaths across the globe. With innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) predicting such diseases early is very important research area. With learning based approaches that exploit knowledge from given samples, it is possible to improve disease prediction process. There are many aspects to proper healthcare such as preventing diseases with suitable diet and lifestyle, early detection of diseases if any and efficient treatment. Data is being accumulated in every domain. However, the healthcare industry is on top of the list as it provides large volumes of data pertaining to human health, diet and drug aspects. The existing literature has not shown adequate research in this direction. The Healthcare industry has an unprecedented impact on the well-being of people across the globe. In the recent observations by World Health Organization (WHO), data science approach towards disease prediction greatly complements existing Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs).This research paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of data science techniques for disease prediction and drug recommendation in healthcare, focusing on a case study involving cardiovascular diseases. The primary objective of this study is to develop a robust predictive model that identifies the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases in patients, and subsequently recommends drug interventions for optimal treatment outcomes. Here we propose Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation Framework (DPDRF). The framework is realized by defining an algorithm known as Cardio Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation (CDP-DR). The Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation algorithm in turn uses different supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). Another algorithm known as Entropy and Gain based Hybrid Feature Selection (EG-HFS) is defined to leverage quality of training leading to performance enhancement of prediction models. The experimental results with cardio disease prediction as a case study revealed that the proposed framework is useful in disease prediction and drug recommendations by using different prediction models.

While there is widespread agreement on the importance of teaching ethics within computing contexts, there is no clear method for its implementation and assessment. Studies focusing on methods for integrating ethics into data science courses reveal that students tend to neglect ethical concerns in their data analysis. Based on the data we collected from questionnaires distributed to undergraduate science and engineering students, this paper expands the discussion beyond human concerns and ethics in data science education. As we will show, students tend to neglect the context when attempting to solve data science questions. We argue that gaps in understanding the context relating to the data result in gaps in the analysis as well as in the interpretation of the data. Thus, we propose anthropological thinking as a pedagogy to overcome the context neglect. Placing the spotlight on the context promotes a holistic understanding of the phenomenon being analyzed, as it includes important considerations that do not necessarily fit the more commonly used term human concerns. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.',\n",
       " 'Handling outliers is an important step in data analysis, and it can be approached through three different ways, namely; accommodation, omission, or winsorization. This article investigates the impact of four winsorization statistics (mean, median, mode, and quantiles) on parameter estimation through an extensive simulation study. Three probability distributions (normal, negative binomial, and exponential) are considered, each with varying degrees of contamination. The simulation results suggest that winsoriza-tion is effective for small contamination levels and large sample sizes. Furthermore, it is recommended to winsorize outliers in symmetric distributions using any of the location parameters. However, for asymmetric distributions, the median should be employed. To illustrate these findings, a real dataset on internet usage session durations for 4,500 users, comprising over 2 million records, are fitted to the exponential distribution.

       " \"Background: The world is becoming increasingly urbanised. As cities around the world continue to grow, it is important for urban planners and policy makers to understand how different urban configuration patterns affect the environment and human health. However, previous studies have provided mixed findings. We aimed to identify European urban configuration types, on the basis of the local climate zones categories and street design variables from Open Street Map, and evaluate their association with motorised traffic flows, surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensities, tropospheric NO2, CO2per person emissions, and age-standardised mortality. Methods: We considered 946 European cities from 31 countries for the analysis defined in the 2018 Urban Audit database, of which 919 European cities were analysed. Data were collected at a 250 m √ó 250 m grid cell resolution. We divided all cities into five concentric rings based on the Burgess concentric urban planning model and calculated the mean values of all variables for each ring. First, to identify distinct urban configuration types, we applied the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction method, followed by the k-means clustering algorithm. Next, statistical differences in exposures (including SUHI) and mortality between the resulting urban configuration types were evaluated using a Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test followed by a post-hoc Dunn's test. Findings: We identified four distinct urban configuration types characterising European cities: compact high density (n=246), open low-rise medium density (n=245), open low-rise low density (n=261), and green low density (n=167). Compact high density cities were a small size, had high population densities, and a low availability of natural areas. In contrast, green low density cities were a large size, had low population densities, and a high availability of natural areas and cycleways. The open low-rise medium and low density cities were a small to medium size with medium to low population densities and low to moderate availability of green areas. Motorised traffic flows and NO2exposure were significantly higher in compact high density and open low-rise medium density cities when compared with green low density and open low-rise low density cities. Additionally, green low density cities had a significantly lower SUHI effect compared with all other urban configuration types. Per person CO2emissions were significantly lower in compact high density cities compared with green low density cities. Lastly, green low density cities had significantly lower mortality rates when compared with all other urban configuration types. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that, although the compact city model is more sustainable, European compact cities still face challenges related to poor environmental quality and health. Our results have notable implications for urban and transport planning policies in Europe and contribute to the ongoing discussion on which city models can bring the greatest benefits for the environment, climate, and health.

       " 'This article presents a novel approach to introducing principal component analysis (PCA), using summary tables and descriptive statistics. Given its applicability across a variety of academic disciplines, this topic offers abundant opportunity for class discussion and activities. However, teaching PCA in an introductory class can be challenging due to the potential abstraction of multivariate datasets, and especially when students have a minimal background in statistics or data science. This method aims to help teachers bridge the gap between basic descriptive statistics and the more advanced concepts of PCA; this is done by disregarding mathematical optimization, while emphasizing the use of summary tables and the programming language R. The focus is on implementing this method in an introductory tertiary data science course; however, it may potentially be used in higher level courses, and across a variety of disciplines. ¬© 2024 Teaching Statistics Trust.',\n",

       " 'The concepts of a consequence relation and operation, though very abstract and theoretical, may be related to specific categories of information systems (i.e. mathematical frontends of data tables); as it has been demonstrated by D. Vakarelov, there exist correspondence between Pawlak information systems and Scott as well as Tarski consequence operations. This line of research goes (via representation) from abstract concepts to data. In this paper we would like to take the opposite direction: from data (via construction) to consequence relations. The main emphasis is laid here not on general categories of consequence relations (e.g. Scott or Tarski ones) but on concrete operators that can be retrieved from information systems (e.g. different examples of Scott consequence). To this end, we employ Galois connections and adjunctions (en masse called Galois mappings) and study the consequence relations that can be built via these maps. The main novelty of our research comes from the investigation of consequence relations induced by adjunctions rather than monotone Galois connections, which have been the main subject of studies so far. Surprisingly, the operations obtained from adjunctions possess a number of counter-intuitive properties, which (in turn) request some intelligible interpretations. And this is our next objective: to make sense of these consequence relations in the context of information processing. ¬© 2024',\n",

Results: Data Science techniques including Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, etc. are being used for tasks such as disease prediction, personalized treatment recommendation, medical imaging analysis, and healthcare resource optimization. Nonetheless, challenges such as data privacy, quality, data access and ethics in using healthcare data were identified as barriers in their extensive implementation. Conclusions: Important insights that could improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare expenditures can be obtained by employing data science techniques on data generated through wearable technology, medical imaging, Electronic Health Records (EHR), etc. To fully utilize data science in healthcare, however, data quality, privacy, and security issues must be resolved, and deliberative frameworks must be created to enable the use of data science in healthcare in an ethical and responsible manner. ¬© The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM) 2024.',\n",
       " 'When designing data science (DS) pipelines, end-users can get overwhelmed by the large and growing set of available data preprocessing and modeling techniques. Intelligent discovery assistants (IDAs) and automated machine learning (AutoML) solutions aim to facilitate end-users by (semi-)automating the process. However, they are expensive to compute and yield limited applicability for a wide range of real-world use cases and application domains. This is due to (a) their need to execute thousands of pipelines to get the optimal one, (b) their limited support of DS tasks, e.g., supervised classification or regression only, and a small, static set of available data preprocessing and ML algorithms; and (c) their restriction to quantifiable evaluation processes and metrics, e.g., tenfold cross-validation using the ROC AUC score for classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose a human-in-the-loop approach for the assisteddesignofdatasciencepipelines using previously executed pipelines. Based on a user query, i.e.,\\xa0data and a DS task, our framework outputs a ranked list of pipeline candidates from which the user can choose to execute or modify in real time. To recommend pipelines, it first identifies relevant datasets and pipelines utilizing efficient similarity search. It then ranks the candidate pipelines using multi-objective sorting and takes user interactions into account to improve suggestions over time. In our experimental evaluation, the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art IDA tool and achieves similar predictive performance with state-of-the-art long-running AutoML solutions while being real-time, generic to any evaluation processes and DS tasks, and extensible to new operators. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.',\n",

Most of the classic approaches to data processing consist of studying the consequences of phenomena rather than the factors of their appearance. At the same time, the factors affecting the behavior of the investigated process are assumed to be random and are not investigated. The article discusses the approach to forecasting the parameters of the trend of statistical time se-ries, which consists of the study of factors that lead to changes in the dynamics of the studied process. This approach potentially has better indicators of adequacy, ac-curacy, and efficiency in obtaining final solutions than classical approaches. The implementation of this approach is shown using an example of the analysis of exchange rate changes.

       " 'An ER diagram is a fundamental visual abstraction to design a database. Modern ER notation has evolved with UML symbols to represent both entities (logical level) and relational tables (physical level). On the other hand, flow diagrams (flowcharts, process flow) remain an important mechanism to visualize the main steps of a data processing pipeline. However, in modern data science projects there is a significant fraction of data that does not come from databases or data that is exported outside the database system, being processed by Python code, without any data model whatsoever. In this paper, we present a novel diagram which is built from source code and its associated browser-based GUI for collaborating on data integration and data preprocessing, mixing diverse data sources and diverse programming languages (mainly Python and SQL). Specifically, our targets are data integration, data cleaning and data transformation, which are needed to derive data sets that can be used as input for a machine learning model. We present a couple of target applications and a preliminary GUI, which partially automates diagram creation. We show our diagram has promise understanding, extending and reusing both data preparation source code and data sets. ¬© 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).',\n",
       " 'Data preprocessing and engineering are essential parts of any AI system, as indicated by the current trend of data-centric AI. However, until now, explainability efforts have almost exclusively focused on models. We propose explanations for preprocessing pipelines that express the impact of each step on the resulting model behavior based on existing feature attribution methods. In the process, we introduce two related but distinct measures of impact for preprocessing steps: Leave-out Impact (What do we lose/gain by leaving out this step?) and Immediate Impact (What do we lose/gain by adding this step at this time?). Both are obtained by constructing variations of the original pipeline and comparing the resulting model behavior represented as feature importance vectors. These measures reflect the intuition of impact but also express the effects of a step and its interactions with the rest of the pipeline on the internal workings of the trained model. ¬© 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).',\n",

The goal of AI, IoT and data science for future communications systems is to create a venue for industry and academics to collaborate on the development of network and system solutions based on data science, AI and IoT. Recent breakthroughs in IoT, mobile and fixed communications and computation have paved the way for a data-centric society of the future. New applications are increasingly reliant on machine-to-machine connections, resulting in unusual workloads and the need for more efficient and dependable infrastructures. Such a wide range of traffic workloads and applications will necessitate dynamic and highly adaptive network environments capable of self-optimization for the task at hand while ensuring high dependability and ultra-low latency. Networking devices, sensors, agents, meters and smart vehicles/systems generate massive amounts of data, necessitating new levels of security, performance and dependability. Such complications necessitate the development of new tools and approaches for providing successful services, management and operation. Predictive network analytics will play a critical role in insight generation, process automation required for adapting and scaling to new demands, resolving issues before they impact operational performance (e.g., preventing network failures and anticipating capacity requirements) and overall network decision-making. To increase user experience and service quality, data mining and analytic techniques for inferring quality of experience (QoE) signals are required. AI, IoT, machine learning, reinforcement learning and network data analytics innovations open new possibilities in areas such as channel modeling and estimation, cognitive communications, interference alignment, mobility management, resource allocation, network control and management, network tomography, multi-agent systems and network ultra-broadband deployment prioritization. These new analytic platforms will aid in the transformation of our networks and user experience. Future networks will enable unparalleled automation and optimization by intelligently gathering, analyzing, learning and controlling huge volumes of information. ¬© 2024 selection and editorial matter, Dr Inam Ullah, Dr Inam Ullah Khan, Dr Mariya Ouaissa, Dr Mariyam Ouaissa, Dr Salma El Hajjami; individual chapters, the contributors.

       " \"Purpose: This study is part of a participatory design research project and aims to develop and study pedagogical frameworks and tools for integrating computational thinking (CT) concepts and data science practices into elementary school classrooms. Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes a pedagogical approach that uses a data science framework the research team developed to assist teachers in providing data science instruction to elementary-aged students. Using phenomenological case study methodology, the authors use classroom observations, student focus groups, video recordings and artifacts to detail ways learners engage in data science practices and understand how they perceive their engagement during activities and learning. Findings: Findings suggest student engagement in data science is enhanced when data problems are contextualized and connected to students‚Äô lived experiences; data analysis and data-based decision-making is practiced in multiple ways; and students are given choices to communicate patterns, interpret graphs and tell data stories. The authors note challenges students experienced with data practices including conflict between inconsistencies in data patterns and lived experiences and focusing on data visualization appearances versus relationships between variables. Originality/value: Data science instruction in elementary schools is an understudied, emerging and important area of data science education. Most elementary schools offer limited data science instruction; few elementary schools offer data science curriculum with embedded CT practices integrated across disciplines.

A number of thus adopted solutions-including facial recognition, predictive policing, and risk assessments-have been contested by researchers and journalists alike. Yet comparatively little research is done at the strategy level, which determines where data science will be deployed in the first place. In this study, we interview 40 practitioners from Police Scotland, investigating what they believe to be crucial to successfully incorporate data science in their ways of working. Bucking the external trend, the participants distanced themselves from tools like facial recognition and risk assessment. Instead of focusing on individual use-cases, their primary concerns for the future were around (i) systemic issues around data is collection and use, (ii) goal misalignment between leadership and operational levels, (iii) the fear that datafication may undervalue important aspects of policing, and (iv) appropriate ways of interaction between data science teams and operational officers. Alongside the insights particular to Police Scotland, our work reaffirms how participatory approaches can go beyond the technical, and uncover structural and political barriers to success. ¬© 2024 Owner/Author.',\n",

This study examined the impact behaviour of AP crystal sizes between 200 and 400 Œºm by varying impact velocities between 3 and 10\\xa0m/s. Based on the outcome of CFEM simulations, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests and a response surface method (RSM) were utilized to construct a mathematical model approximating the relationships between simulation inputs and outcomes. Both computational and experimental results show that the local strain rate has a considerable positive correlation with crystal size, and the rate of temperature change has positive correlations with both crystal size and impact velocity. Further, it was observed that stiffness and compression energy are the primary factors to variances in local strain rate and rate of change of temperature.

A PRISMA search strategy was used to search nine electronic databases in November 2020 and January 2022. Of 7325 studies identified, thirty-six studies were selected from seventeen countries, and content was analysed thematically and summarised in an evidence table. Studies were published between 2014 and 2022 and used data from seven different social media platforms (Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest, Sina Weibo and mixed platforms). Five themes of research were identified: dietary patterns, cooking and recipes, diet and health, public health and nutrition and food in general. Papers developed a sentiment or emotion analysis tool or used available open-source tools. Accuracy to predict sentiment ranged from 33¬∑33% (open-source engine) to 98¬∑53% (engine developed for the study). The average proportion of sentiment was 38¬∑8% positive, 46¬∑6% neutral and 28¬∑0% negative. Additional data science techniques used included topic modelling and network analysis.

In this study, we develop theory to advance our understanding of online coping with an explicitly social focus using computational grounded theorizing and machine learning (ML) techniques applied to a large corpus of work-related conversations on Reddit. Specifically, our theoretical model sheds light on the dynamics of the online social coping process related to the domain of work. We show that how sharers and listeners interact and react to one another depends on the content of stressors shared, the social coping behaviors used when sharing, and whether the sharer and listener belong to the same occupational context. We contribute to the social coping literature in three ways. First, we clarify how social actors respond to cues embedded in the social coping attempt. Second, we examine the moderating role that such responses play in shaping sharer outcomes. Finally, we extend theory on social coping with work-related stressors to the online domain. Taken together, this research highlights the importance of the dynamic interplay between sharer and listener in the context of online social coping. ¬© 2022 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\",\n",
       " 'With the emerging era of E-commerce and online shopping, people are also in a habit to receive default product recommendations on the web pages that they access. Google is already providing such suggestions. Till now recommendations were made only based on previous sentiments or feedback or ratings, but this research has improved the product recommendation method by including one more parameter for the same. This article represents two parameters for making predictions of product allocation to a new customer. These parameters are ratings given by the existing users for that particular product and the region to which the new customer belongs. Following these parameters, a prediction model and an algorithm, Improved_Collab_Similarity, have been implemented. The dataset has been developed where India as a country along with all its States has been considered for products which are popular for their creation based on regional and ancient skills of the people belonging to that area. Results for the mentioned prediction model have been discussed in this article where generally precision increases with the increase in a number of products but at some points, it does not increase when a smaller number of that product was purchased by the customers. ¬© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.',\n",

It is important to study student satisfaction to understand how students feel about the quality of education, academic experiences, access to facilities, campus life, and extracurricular activities. A questionnaire was designed for the study, and data was collected from 81 students enrolled in master‚Äôs and PhD programs at the African Centre of Excellence in Data Science. In this study, a chi-square test was conducted to select factors associated with students‚Äô satisfaction to be included in the model, and a multivariable logistic regression model was used for the analysis. The findings indicated that gender, level of study, programme of study, and the country of origin were not associated with student satisfaction. In contrast, curriculum relevance, accessing course materials, learning facilities, and the support from the ACE were statistically associated with students‚Äô satisfaction. Therefore, the logistic regression model solely took into account variables which are associated with students‚Äô satisfaction. This study uncovered the difficulties and opportunities affecting students‚Äô satisfaction, and the findings showed that accessing course materials and satisfaction with centre support were statistically significant, while curriculum relevance and satisfaction with learning facilities were not. The findings from this study inform higher learning institutions and decision makers about how to improve the caliber and efficiency of higher education. ¬© 2024 Conscientia Beam.

Volunteered geographic information (VGI), being material created by users, has had a substantial impact on making geographic information accessible to everybody, enabling people to actively engage in the creation and management of data. The incorporation of volunteered geographic information (VGI) into government operations has introduced novel prospects for enhancing service provision in diverse sectors such as education, health, transportation, and waste management. In addition, data science has enhanced VGI by using sophisticated methodologies like artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), big data, and blockchain, thereby transforming the whole framework of government service provision.

Due to the rapid development of data science (DS), promising progress has been made in the transition toward CE in the past decade. DS offers various methods to achieve accurate predictions, accelerate product sustainable design, prolong asset life, optimize the infrastructure needed to circulate materials, and provide evidence-based insights. Despite the exciting scientific advances in this field, there still lacks a comprehensive review on this topic to summarize past achievements, synthesize knowledge gained, and navigate future research directions. In this paper, we try to summarize how DS accelerated the transition to CE. We conducted a critical review of where and how DS has helped the CE transition with a focus on four areas including (1) characterizing socioeconomic metabolism, (2) reducing unnecessary waste generation by enhancing material efficiency and optimizing product design, (3) extending product lifetime through repair, and (4) facilitating waste reuse and recycling.

       " 'Successful data-driven science requires complex data engineering pipelines to clean, transform, and alter data in preparation for machine learning, and robust results can only be achieved when each step in the pipeline can be justified, and its effect on the data explained. In this framework, we aim at providing data scientists with facilities to gain an in-depth understanding of how each step in the pipeline affects the data, from the raw input to training sets ready to be used for learning. Starting from an extensible set of data preparation operators commonly used within a data science setting, in this work we present a provenance management infrastructure for generating, storing, and querying very granular accounts of data transformations, at the level of individual elements within datasets whenever possible. Then, from the formal definition of a core set of data science preprocessing operators, we derive a provenance semantics embodied by a collection of templates expressed in PROV, a standard model for data provenance. Using those templates as a reference, our provenance generation algorithm generalises to any operator with observable input/output pairs. We provide a prototype implementation of an application-level provenance capture library to produce, in a semiautomatic way, complete provenance documents that account for the entire pipeline. We report on the ability of that reference implementation to capture provenance in real ML benchmark pipelines and over TCP-DI synthetic data. We finally show how the collected provenance can be used to answer a suite of provenance benchmark queries that underpin some common pipeline inspection questions, as expressed on the Data Science Stack Exchange. ¬© 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

       " 'Herein we report a method for a stereoconvergent synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes in two steps from simple ketone starting materials. The key step is a nickel-catalyzed reduction of the corresponding enol tosylates that predominantly relies on a monophosphine ligand to direct the stereoconvergent formation of either the E- or Z-trisubstituted alkene products. Reaction optimization was accomplished using a data science workflow including monophosphine training set design, statistical modeling, and multiobjective Bayesian optimization. The optimization campaign significantly improved access to both the E- and Z-trisubstituted products in up to ‚àº90:10 diastereoselectivity and >90% yield. After identifying superior ligands using training set design, only 25 reactions were required for each objective (E- and Z-isomer formation) to converge on improved reaction parameters from a search space of ‚àº30,000 potential conditions using the EDBO+ platform. Additionally, a hierarchical machine learning model was developed to predict the stereoselectivity of untested monophosphine ligands to achieve a validation mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.1% selectivity (0.21 kcal/mol). Ultimately, we present a synergistic data science workflow leveraging the integration of training set design, statistical modeling, and Bayesian optimization, thereby expanding access to stereodefined trisubstituted alkenes. ¬© 2024 American Chemical Society',\n",

Leveraging data science techniques, particularly those rooted in artificial intelligence and machine learning, offers a promising avenue for comprehending the intricacies of complex systems without necessitating detailed knowledge of underlying dynamics. In this paper, we demonstrate that multiscale entropy (MSE) is pivotal in describing the steady state of complex systems. Introducing the multiscale entropy dynamics (MED) methodology, we provide a framework for dissecting system dynamics and uncovering the driving forces behind their evolution. Our investigation reveals that the MED methodology facilitates the expression of complex system dynamics through a Generalized Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger Equation (GNSE) that thus demonstrates its potential applicability across diverse complex systems. By elucidating the entropic underpinnings of complexity, our study paves the way for a deeper understanding of dynamic phenomena.

       " 'OBJECTIVE: Perform a scoping review of supervised machine learning in pediatric critical care to identify published applications, methodologies, and implementation frequency to inform best practices for the development, validation, and reporting of predictive models in pediatric critical care. DESIGN: Scoping review and expert opinion. SETTING: We queried CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCO), Cochrane Library (Wiley), Embase (Elsevier), Ovid Medline, and PubMed for articles published between 2000 and 2022 related to machine learning concepts and pediatric critical illness. Articles were excluded if the majority of patients were adults or neonates, if unsupervised machine learning was the primary methodology, or if information related to the development, validation, and/or implementation of the model was not reported. Article selection and data extraction were performed using dual review in the Covidence tool, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. SUBJECTS: Articles reporting on the development, validation, or implementation of supervised machine learning models in the field of pediatric critical care medicine. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 5075 identified studies, 141 articles were included. Studies were primarily (57%) performed at a single site. The majority took place in the United States (70%). Most were retrospective observational cohort studies. More than three-quarters of the articles were published between 2018 and 2022. The most common algorithms included logistic regression and random forest. Predicted events were most commonly death, transfer to ICU, and sepsis. Only 14% of articles reported external validation, and only a single model was implemented at publication. Reporting of validation methods, performance assessments, and implementation varied widely. Follow-up with authors suggests that implementation remains uncommon after model publication. CONCLUSIONS: Publication of supervised machine learning models to address clinical challenges in pediatric critical care medicine has increased dramatically in the last 5 years. While these approaches have the potential to benefit children with critical illness, the literature demonstrates incomplete reporting, absence of external validation, and infrequent clinical implementation. ¬© 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

       " \"Fluidized beds are critical in numerous industrial applications, including chemical processing and energy production. Accurate modeling of solid particles and fluids within these beds is essential for process optimization and improved efficiency. In this study, we developed a machine learning model to predict the coefficient of restitution (COR) of solid particles in fluidized beds. Four variables‚Äîcollision velocity, effective temperature, effective mass, and effective elastic modulus‚Äîwere used in the model. Our dataset comprised 2446 data points from previous literature. We employed self-organizing map (SOM) and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches for data analysis. The initial ANN model, which did not incorporate data clustering, exhibited an impressive coefficient of determination (R-squared) of 0.989, indicating its high accuracy. To enhance the model further, we clustered the data into four groups using SOM and developed separate ANN models for each group. All four models achieved R-squared greater than 0.99, illustrating the effectiveness of data clustering. The resulting model can be integrated into simulation software, such as MFIX, to provide a more precise representation of fluidized bed behavior across various industrial settings. The findings emphasize the potential of machine learning models to enhance fluidized bed simulations, leading to increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness in industrial processes. Future studies should explore the inclusion of additional variables and extend the model's application to different industrial processes. Additionally, incorporating recommendations for optimizing fluidized bed behavior based on the model's predictions would provide valuable insights for process engineers. ¬© 2024 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

High-temperature melt vitrification technology is an effective solution to realize the detoxification and resource utilization of HMHW. This paper summarizes and analyzes the control parameters of the existing vitrification treatment of HMHW. The phase transformation process of temperature, slag content, and CAS ratio (CaO-Al2O3-SiO2) in the vitrification treatment of zinc leaching residue (ZLR) was investigated around the vitreous content. The common evolution characteristics of the formed vitrification products in infrared spectrum, UV‚Äìvis diffuse reflection spectrum, and microstructures were revealed. The idea of using the maximum UV‚Äìvis absorption intensity to qualitatively determine the vitreous content of the products is proposed. Moreover, the correlation between experimental parameters and vitreous content was quantified by combining the data science method, and the mapping of the whole process of ZLR vitrification treatment was constructed. This work provides reliable parameter guidance and method induction for the vitrification treatment of HMHW, especially for wastes with less glassy matrix such as Ca and Si. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

However, knowledge gap remains as which level satellite data should be used as the critical proxy variable, and how to improve data-driven models with domain knowledge are also still elusive. By taking surface NO2concentration mapping as illustration, here we performed inter-comparison studies between a set of machine-learned surface NO2concentration estimation models established with different levels of satellite products, varying from Level 1 (L1) apparent radiance from TROPOMI on board Sentinel-5p to Level 2 (L2) NO2slant column density (SCD) and tropospheric vertical column density (VCD). TROPOMI bands sensitive to surface NO2were firstly pinpointed via radiative transfer simulations while band ratios between nine sensitive and adjacent insensitive channels were then calculated and used as the counterpart of raw radiance observations. The results indicated that the prediction model trained with L1 band ratios at few discrete channels yielded higher prediction accuracy (R2= 0.71, RMSE = 7.98 Œºg m‚àí3) than that using raw L1 radiance data at all available bands (R2= 0.68, RMSE = 8.40 Œºg m‚àí3), largely benefiting from the improved signal-to-noise ratio and reduced model complexity due to fewer band ratio inputs. Yet even higher modeling accuracies were attained with L2 data products, the model with SCD (R2= 0.78, RMSE = 6.54 Œºg m‚àí3) were found to perform even slightly better than that of VCD (R2= 0.77, RMSE = 6.79 Œºg m‚àí3), though the latter is supposed to better correlate with surface NO2variations. The modeling accuracy was further improved with the inclusion of solar zenith angle, aerosol optical depth, surface albedo and pressure that are highly associated with air mass factor, with R2improved to 0.80 and RMSE reduced to 6.28 Œºg m‚àí3. Overall, our results not only provide actional guidance on satellite-based surface NO2concentration modeling but also underscore the critical importance of domain knowledge in improving machine-learned models to aid in large scale air quality surveillance. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd',\n",

A data-science-driven approach to substrate scope evaluation was coupled to high throughput experimentation (HTE) to facilitate statistical modeling in order to inform mechanistic studies. Reaction kinetics, catalyst structural studies, and density functional theory (DFT) transition state analysis elucidated the turnover-limiting step to be the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate and provided key insights into the catalyst-substrate structure-activity relationships responsible for the origin of the enantioselectivity. This study offers a reliable method for accessing enantioenriched sulfonimidamides to propel their application as pharmacophores and serves as an example of the mechanistic insight that can be gleaned from integrating data science and traditional physical organic techniques. ¬© 2024 American Chemical Society',\n",
       " 'Data science is a science that is currently very popular and can be applied in various industries. Of course, the need for proficient people in this field is growing in demand by many businesses, including large corporations. Data science is a science that combines expertise in a particular field of science with programming, mathematics, and statistics skills. The goal is to extract knowledge or information from data. The problem that usually occurs in the data science process is at the data modeling stage, namely the accuracy of the mathematical model that will be used to obtain the estimated parameter values. To overcome this problem, this research was conducted to test the correctness of analytic derivatives in mathematical models and conduct data modeling using analytic derivatives that have been tested to obtain the estimated value of each parameter. The validation process is carried out using an analytic and numeric gradient comparison. If the comparison of the two values is close to zero, then the analytical derivatives used are correct. The parameter estimation method used is the Maximum Likelihood Estimation. In this research, it was concluded that the value of the analytic gradient is the same or close to the numeric gradient value for each parameter so that the analytic derivatives are correct and can be used for the next stage. With the results of this research, the expected implication is to get more accurate data modeling so that the conclusions obtained are more precise. ¬© 2024 Author(s).',\n",

A country's progress in catching up with other countries also depends heavily on two other factors, namely the quality of institutions and the availability of infrastructure. The universities must create the next generation of the nation that can lay the foundation for Indonesia to become a developed country. However, since the Covid-19 pandemic, this situation has dramatically affected the learning process in universities. To prevent the spread of Covid-19 in Indonesia, the government has implemented a hybrid learning system for higher education levels. This hybrid system requires Internet access by students and faculty to help support the learning process from campus. However, the current hybrid system has not effectively and efficiently replaced formal education. Therefore, the research team took the initiative to conduct this study to observe the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on learning outcomes through regression analysis with single and multiple predictors. The method used is regression analysis, where the parameter estimation uses the Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The regression model with single and multiple predictors resulted in the same conclusion. The relationship between the predictor variables and the responses was positive. With the results of this study, the expected implication is the utilization of the developed model to obtain policy-making scenarios by the university to achieve the targets. ¬© 2024 Author(s).\",\n",

       " \"Purpose: The study aims to develop a model that supports the application of data science techniques for real estate professionals in the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) era. The present 4IR era gave birth to big data sets and is beyond real estate professionals' analysis techniques. This has led to a situation where most real estate professionals rely on their intuition while neglecting a rigorous analysis for real estate investment appraisals. The heavy reliance on their intuition has been responsible for the under-performance of real estate investment, especially in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilised a survey questionnaire to randomly source data from real estate professionals. The questionnaire was analysed using a combination of Statistical package for social science (SPSS) V24 and Analysis of a Moment Structures (AMOS) graphics V27 software. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to break down the variables (drivers) into meaningful dimensions helpful in developing the conceptual framework. The framework was validated using covariance-based structural equation modelling. The model was validated using fit indices like discriminant validity, standardised root mean square (SRMR), comparative fit index (CFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), etc. Findings: The model revealed that an inclusive educational system, decentralised real estate market and data management system are the major drivers for applying data science techniques to real estate professionals. Also, real estate professionals' application of the drivers will guarantee an effective data analysis of real estate investments. Originality/value: Numerous studies have clamoured for adopting data science techniques for real estate professionals. There is a lack of studies on the drivers that will guarantee the successful adoption of data science techniques. A modern form of data analysis for real estate professionals was also proposed in the study. ¬© 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.\",\n",

In this pilot, students were asked to demonstrate their newly learned data science skills by teaching them to individuals without data science backgrounds. The evidence of learning will be illustrated through an in-depth analysis of the students\\' teaching products. These products consist of two parts: (1) \"Teaching Preparation\"materials, such as Python Notebooks containing problems and solutions crafted by the students, and (2) \"Teaching Implementation\", video recordings of real-time interactions between the students and their \"tutees.\"The paper will also present qualitative feedback from the students, highlighting promising signs of engagement and acceptance.

       " 'Table transformations are a critical skill to master in order to fluently work with data. In introductory data science courses, however, students have found these transformations particularly challenging to learn. One complex transformation is the pivot transformation, which reorganizes a table based on aggregation and summarizing along selected columns and rows. Current assessments test student understanding in static scenarios. Thus, there is an opportunity to help students explicitly work through the steps and variables needed to express a pivot transformation in a randomizable manner. As such, we explore whether a dynamic digital assessment for the pivot transformation can effectively achieve mastery learning towards this skill. Our design is inspired by Parsons problems, in which answer components (pivot table output labels and values) can be composed into the output of a pivot transformation. A question can be derived from a small randomized dataset, and randomized Pandas code that operates upon the dataset and can be autograded. We plan to conduct a pilot study with data science students to investigate whether 1) using a programmable online platform to practice pivot tables helps improve performance on exams, and 2) randomization and instant feedback on the online platform contribute to improved student learning. ¬© 2024 Owner/Author.',\n",

Addressing this gap, we adopted a student-centric approach to craft a disability fairness teaching intervention. A focus group of students experienced in ML and accessible computing underscored the significance of engagement and scaffolding strategies for effectively learning intricate topics. Consequently, we crafted a disability fairness hands-on programming assignment that delves into uncovering disability bias with a lens that takes intersectionality into account.

The study explored data science and causal learning methods to transform RWD into reliable real-world evidence, aiming to provide an innovative approach for RWCE-TCM. This study proposes a 10-step data science methodology to address the challenges posed by diverse and complex data in RWCE-TCM. The methodology involves several key steps, including data integration and warehouse building, high-dimensional feature selection, the use of interpretable statistical machine learning algorithms, complex networks, and graph network analysis, knowledge mining techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning, observational study design, and the application of artificial intelligence tools to build an intelligent engine for translational analysis. The goal is to establish a method for clinical positioning, applicable population screening, and mining the structural association of TCM characteristic therapies. In addition, the study adopts the principle of real-world research and a causal learning method for TCM clinical data. We constructed a multidimensional clinical knowledge map of \"disease-syndrome-symptom-prescription-medicine\"to enhance our understanding of the diagnosis and treatment laws of TCM, clarify the unique therapies, and explore information conducive to individualized treatment. The causal inference process of observational data can address confounding bias and reduce individual heterogeneity, promoting the transformation of TCM RWD into reliable clinical evidence.

We propose a packet status prediction model for data packets that travel through a wireless network based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and are exposed to five different types of interference in a controlled experimentation environment. The proposed model focuses on the packetization process and its impact on network robustness. This study explores the challenges posed by packet loss, particularly in the context of interference, and puts forth the hypothesis that specific environmental conditions are linked to packet loss occurrences. The contribution of this work lies in advancing our understanding of the conditions leading to packet loss in wireless networks. Data are retrieved with a single CC2531 USB Dongle Packet Sniffer, whose pieces of information on packets become the features of each packet from which the classifier model will gather the training data with the aim of predicting whether a packet will unsuccessfully arrive at its destination. We found that interference causes more packet loss than that caused by various devices using a WiFi communication protocol simultaneously. In addition, we found that the most important predictors are network strength and packet size; low network strength tends to lead to more packet loss, especially for larger packets.

       " 'Translational bioinformatics and data science play a crucial role in biomarker discovery as it enables translational research and helps to bridge the gap between the bench research and the bedside clinical applications. Thanks to newer and faster molecular profiling technologies and reducing costs, there are many opportunities for researchers to explore the molecular and physiological mechanisms of diseases. Biomarker discovery enables researchers to better characterize patients, enables early detection and intervention/prevention and predicts treatment responses. Due to increasing prevalence and rising treatment costs, mental health (MH) disorders have become an important venue for biomarker discovery with the goal of improved patient diagnostics, treatment and care. Exploration of underlying biological mechanisms is the key to the understanding of pathogenesis and pathophysiology of MH disorders. In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms of MH disorders, we reviewed the major accomplishments in the MH space from a bioinformatics and data science perspective, summarized existing knowledge derived from molecular and cellular data and described challenges and areas of opportunities in this space. ¬© 2024 Oxford University Press.

       " 'Background: Aldosterone plays a key role in the neurohormonal drive of heart failure. Systematic prioritization of drug targets using bioinformatics and database-driven decision-making can provide a competitive advantage in therapeutic R&D. This study investigated the evidence on the druggability of these aldosterone targets in heart failure. Methods: The target disease predictability of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and aldosterone synthase (AS) in cardiac failure was evaluated using Open Targets target-disease association scores. The Open Targets database collections were downloaded to MongoDB and queried according to the desired aggregation level, and the results were retrieved from the Europe PMC (data type: text mining), ChEMBL (data type: drugs), Open Targets Genetics Portal (data type: genetic associations), and IMPC (data type: genetic associations) databases. The target tractability of MR and AS in the cardiovascular system was investigated by computing activity scores in a curated ChEMBL database using supervised machine learning. Results: The medians of the association scores of the MR and AS groups were similar, indicating a comparable predictability of the target disease. The median of the MR activity scores group was significantly lower than that of AS, indicating that AS has higher target tractability than MR [Hodges-Lehmann difference 0.62 (95%CI 0.53‚Äì0.70, p < 0.0001]. The cumulative distributions of the overall multiplatform association scores of cardiac diseases with MR were considerably higher than with AS, indicating more advanced investigations on a wider range of disorders evaluated for MR (Kolmogorov-Smirnov D = 0.36, p = 0.0009). In curated ChEMBL, MR had a higher cumulative distribution of activity scores in experimental cardiovascular assays than AS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov D = 0.23, p < 0.0001). Documented clinical trials for MR in heart failures surfaced in database searches, none for AS. Conclusions: Although its clinical development has lagged behind that of MR, our findings indicate that AS is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac failure. The multiplatform-integrated identification used in this study allowed us to comprehensively explore the available scientific evidence on MR and AS for heart failure therapy. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd',\n",
       " 'Phase transformations are a challenging problem in materials science, which lead to changes in properties and may impact performance of material systems in various applications. We introduce a general framework for the analysis of particle growth kinetics by utilizing concepts from machine learning and graph theory. As a model system, we use image sequences of atomic force microscopy showing the crystallization of an amorphous fluoroelastomer film. To identify crystalline particles in an amorphous matrix and track the temporal evolution of the particle dispersion, we have developed quantitative methods of 2D analysis. 700 image sequences were analyzed using a neural network architecture, achieving 0.97 pixel-wise classification accuracy as a measure of the correctly classified pixels. The growth kinetics of isolated and impinged particles were tracked throughout time using these image sequences. The relationship between image sequences and spatiotemporal graph representations was explored to identify the proximity of crystallites from each other. The framework enables the analysis of all image sequences without the requirement of sampling for specific particles or timesteps for various materials systems. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.',\n",

       " 'Healthcare systems have made rapid progress towards combining data science with precision medicine, particularly in pharmacogenomics. With the lack of predictability in medication effectiveness from patient to patient, acquiring the specifics of their genotype would be highly advantageous for patient treatment. Genotype-guided dosing adjustment improves clinical decision-making and helps optimize doses to deliver medications with greater efficacy and within safe margins. Current databases demand extensive effort to locate relevant genetic dosing information. To address this problem, Patient Optimization Pharmacogenomics (POPGx) was constructed. The objective of this paper is to describe the development of POPGx, a tool to simplify the approach for healthcare providers to determine pharmacogenomic dosing recommendations for patients taking multiple medications. Additionally, this tool educates patients on how their allele variations may impact gene function in case they need further healthcare consultations. POPGx was created on Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME). KNIME is a modular environment that allows users to conduct code-free data analysis. The POPGx workflow can access Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines and subsequently be able to present relevant dosing and counseling information. A KNIME representational state transfer (REST) application program interface (API) node was established to retrieve information from CPIC and drugs that are exclusively metabolized through CYP450, and these drugs were processed simultaneously to demonstrate competency of the workflow. The POPGx program provides a time-efficient method for users to retrieve relevant, patient-specific medication selection and dosing recommendations. Users input metabolizer gene, genetic allele data, and medication list to retrieve clear dosing information. The program is automated to display current guideline recommendations from CPIC. The integration of this program into healthcare systems has the potential to revolutionize patient care by giving healthcare practitioners an easy way to prescribe medications with greater efficacy and safety by utilizing the latest advancements in the field of pharmacogenomics.

       " 'Objective The unprecedented events of 2020 required a pivot in scientific training to better prepare the biomedical research workforce to address global pandemics, structural racism, and social inequities that devastate human health individually and erode it collectively. Furthermore, this pivot had to be accomplished in the virtual environment given the nation-wide lockdown. Methods These needs and context led to leveraging of the San Francisco Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (SF BUILD) theories of change to innovate a Virtual BUILD Research Collaboratory (VBRC). The purpose of VBRC was to train Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) students to apply their unique perspectives to biomedical research. These training activities were evaluated using a pre-post survey design that included both validated and new psychosocial scales. A new scale was piloted to measure culturally relevant pedagogy. Results VBRC scholars increased science identity on two items: thinking of myself as a scientist (+1point, p = 0.006) and belonging to a community of scientists (+1point, p = 0.069). Overall, scholars perceived stress also decreased over VBRC (-2.35 points, p = 0.02). Post VBRC, scholars had high agency scores (Œº = 11.02, Md = 12, range = 6‚Äì12, œÉ = 1.62) and cultural humility scores (Œº = 22.11, Md = 23, range = 12‚Äì24, œÉ = 2.71). No notable race/ethnic differences were found in any measures. Conclusions Taken together, our innovative approach to data science training for BIPOC in unprecedented times shows promise for better preparing the workforce critically needed to address the fundamental gaps in knowledge at the intersection of public health, structural racism, and biomedical sciences. ¬© 2024 Ceberio et al.

       " 'Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a significant public health issue. It is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia and presents with severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses have provided some insight into disease pathology. Variants within SNCA, GBA, APOE, SNCB, and MAPT have been shown to be associated with DLB in repeated genomic studies. Transcriptomic analysis, conducted predominantly on candidate genes, has identified signatures of synuclein aggregation, protein degradation, amyloid deposition, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the upregulation of heat-shock proteins in DLB. Yet, the understanding of DLB molecular pathology is incomplete. This precipitates the current clinical position whereby there are no available disease-modifying treatments or blood-based diagnostic biomarkers. Data science methods have the potential to improve disease understanding, optimising therapeutic intervention and drug development, to reduce disease burden. Genomic prediction will facilitate the early identification of cases and the timely application of future disease-modifying treatments. Transcript-level analyses across the entire transcriptome and machine learning analysis of multi-omic data will uncover novel signatures that may provide clues to DLB pathology and improve drug development. This review will discuss the current genomic and transcriptomic understanding of DLB, highlight gaps in the literature, and describe data science methods that may advance the field. ¬© 2024 by the authors.',\n",

       " 'As a nascent field within the academy, the contours, attributes, and bounties of data science are still indeterminate and contested. We studied how participants in an initiative to establish data science at a large American research university defined data science and articulated their relationships to the field. We discuss two contrasting visions for data science among our research participants. One vision is a transdisciplinary view portraying data science as a phenomenon with transcendent, appropriative, and impositional qualities that sits apart from academic domains. Another view of data science‚Äîone that was far more prevalent among our research subjects‚Äîcasts data science as grounded, relational, and adaptive, emerging from crosspollination of numerous academic domains. We argue that this latter formulation represents a more quotidian reality of data science and positions the field as an extradiscipline, defined as a field that exists to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, skills, tools, and methods from an indeterminate and fluctuating set of disciplinary perspectives while conserving the boundaries of those disciplines. We argue that the dueling transdisciplinary and extradisciplinary visions for data science have important implications for how the field will mature, and that the extradiscipline concept opens novel directions for studying academic knowledge production in STS, contributing additional precision to the literature on disciplinarity and its permutations. ¬© The Author(s) 2023.',\n",

With the increasing complexity of microstructures and mechanical properties of materials, it has become extremely difficult to develop more complex phenomenological constitutive models. Non-universal material models, which are difficult to relate to material properties and manufacturing processes, have become one of the main problems limiting plastic forming and processing, and also pose a serious challenge to the development of plasticity theory. The development of artificial intelligence and data science opened up new possibilities in materials and mechanical sciences. With the rapid development of material design and application, the traditional explicit constitutive model is not needed, the theoretical modelling approaches to plastic deformation that reflect the relationship between the microstructures and macroscopic properties of materials come into being. Among them, the new paradigm modelling theories represented by mechanistically informed neural networks, efficient multi-scale clustering analysis and model-free data-driven computational mechanics have their distinctive features and significant advantages, which are the most promising simulation methods.

       " 'Interactions between catalysts and substrates can be highly complex and dynamic, often complicating the development of models to either predict or understand such processes. A dirhodium(II)-catalyzed C-H insertion of donor/donor carbenes into 2-alkoxybenzophenone substrates to form benzodihydrofurans was selected as a model system to explore nonlinear methods to achieve a mechanistic understanding. We found that the application of traditional methods of multivariate linear regression (MLR) correlating DFT-derived descriptors of catalysts and substrates leads to poorly performing models. This inspired the introduction of nonlinear descriptor relationships into modeling by applying the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) algorithm. Based on SISSO-generated descriptors, a high-performing MLR model was identified that predicts external validation points well. Mechanistic interpretation was aided by the deconstruction of feature relationships using chemical space maps, decision trees, and linear descriptors. Substrates were found to have a strong dependence on steric effects for determining their innate cyclization selectivity preferences. Catalyst reactive site features can then be matched to product features to tune or override the resultant diastereoselectivity within the substrate-dictated ranges. This case study presents a method for understanding complex interactions often encountered in catalysis by using nonlinear modeling methods and linear deconvolution by pattern recognition. ¬© 2023 The Authors.

One group received formative feedback, offering detailed insights and guidance, while the other group received binary feedback, indicating only right or wrong answers. Our analysis focused on three programming exercises of increasing complexity, assessing how each type of feedback influenced the learners' performance. Results indicate minimal differences in performance between the two feedback groups, suggesting that the type of feedback may not significantly impact learner outcomes in environments where participants are already actively engaged and the tasks are not overly challenging. The findings challenge the assumption that more detailed feed-back universally enhances learning, highlighting the importance of aligning feedback strategies with learner proficiency and task difficulty. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse in programming education by suggesting that MOOC providers might optimize resource allocation by tailoring feedback mechanisms to the specific needs of the learner population, thereby enhancing both educational efficiency and effectiveness. ¬© 2024 IEEE.\",\n",

       " 'This study presents a mobile application (app) that facilitates undergraduate students to learn data science using their own full-body motion data. The app captures a user‚Äôs movements through the built-in camera of a mobile device and processes the images for data generation using BlazePose, an open-source computer vision model for real-time pose estimation. Students can be entirely involved in the data collection process through the app. Consequently, the motion data is contextually rich and holds personal relevance for them. This connection allows students to establish a direct relationship between their body movements and the corresponding motion data, facilitating a deeper understanding of the data. The app then takes advantage of this motion data as a data source to demonstrate various concepts and techniques in data science. As examples of the proposed learning framework, we introduce two learning modules, one focused on principal component analysis and the other on k-means clustering. To reduce learning demands, the app also provides various visual aids, such as interactive graphs and figures, that simplify the learning by visualizing the geometric interpretation of the motion data. Strategies to encompass other data science methods are also discussed for further improvement. ¬© Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2024.',\n",
       " 'The rise of interest in data science raises questions about what changes may be needed in how we address the teaching of statistics with primary children. In this paper, we use a broad definition of data science to outline three foundational aspects that could be addressed during the schooling years: (1) reasoning with data; (2) computational thinking; and (3) inquiry-based learning. Drawing on video data and artefacts from a primary classroom in Australia (children aged 9‚Äì10\\xa0years old), we examined how a class generated and grappled with a complex, ambiguous problem about the risks and benefits of their activities in cyberspace. The interdisciplinary lesson sequence engaged the children with non-standard data, data privacy, and ethical issues in age-appropriate ways. The analysis used an iterative process that annotated video logs, identified and transcribed critical events linked to these three foundational aspects, and coded these data to make connections within and across the data. The findings suggest a process for introducing children to age-appropriate problems that can be addressed by data science that reflect contexts in their world. Implications of the study provide teachers, researchers, and curriculum developers suggestions for embedding data science education into primary school. ¬© Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc. 2024.',\n",
       " 'Early detection of stuck pipes during drilling operations is crucial and challenging. Some of the existing studies on the stuck pipe detection have adopted supervised machine learning approaches that employ datasets for ‚Äústuck‚Äù and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. However, for early detection before the occurrence of stuck pipe, the application of ordinal binary classification in supervised machine learning has presented several elemental concerns, such as limited stuck pipe data, and lack of an exact ‚Äústuck sign‚Äù before occurrence. Our previous studies proposed unsupervised machine learning approaches using data on the normal activities with long short-term memories and autoencoder, the mixture probability model, and graph attention model, and presented the possibility of predicting a stuck pipe. On the other hand, there observed false positives responding the operation of drilling equipment or changes in drilling data. We introduce a data science approach, including machine learning, incorporating physical knowledge to overcome frequent false positives. This study initially introduces the stuck pipe predictions using unsupervised machine learning approaches, and a typical false positive case. Subsequently, we present machine learning integrating physical knowledge and demonstrate early stuck pipe detection using field data containing stuck pipe events. The results show significant suppression of false positives. Our machine learning approach is expected to contribute to considerable reduction of nonproductive time in drilling operations, potentially preventing well abandonment.

The findings showed that the inclusion of the meteorological variables improves the accuracy of modeling both COVID-19 cases and deaths, for all the chosen countries‚Äô cumulative confirmed cases except Italy and Sri Lanka. However, in the case of modeling deaths, it is observed that the inclusion of meteorological variables was not able to enhance the forecasting accuracy of the model in each of the selected countries.

Similarly, time series data refers to a set of values arranged in the form of stock prices, sensor data, application telemetry, and click stream data. Anomaly is an unusual activity which is different from normal behavior. There are different methods adopted to find anomalies and trends in time series data in data science. Irrespective of technological advances in anomaly detection and system monitoring, there is still the risk of false positives. There are several anomaly detection models - some are generic while some are domain-specific. However, there is still a lack of a sufficient algorithm that can work with various datasets. Hence, this study will discuss various types of anomalies and components of time series data. This study will also propose a framework based on machine learning methods for detecting anomalies and selecting appropriate models for time series data analysis. This study will also present a taxonomy to define several aspects of 'anomaly detection in time-series data. Performing anomaly detection regarding the context or types of activities a system is exposed to is one of the major challenges in existing techniques for anomaly detection.

       " 'Background: Social determinants of health (SDOH) are critical drivers of health disparities and patient outcomes. However, accessing and collecting patient-level SDOH data can be operationally challenging in the emergency department (ED) clinical setting, requiring innovative approaches. Objective: This scoping review examines the potential of AI and data science for modeling, extraction, and incorporation of SDOH data specifically within EDs, further identifying areas for advancement and investigation. Methods: We conducted a standardized search for studies published between 2015 and 2022, across Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Web of Science, and ERIC databases. We focused on identifying studies using AI or data science related to SDOH within emergency care contexts or conditions. Two specialized reviewers in emergency medicine (EM) and clinical informatics independently assessed each article, resolving discrepancies through iterative reviews and discussion. We then extracted data covering study details, methodologies, patient demographics, care settings, and principal outcomes. Results: Of the 1047 studies screened, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Notably, 9 out of 26 (35%) studies were solely concentrated on ED patients. Conditions studied spanned broad EM complaints and included sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, and asthma. The majority of studies (n=16) explored multiple SDOH domains, with homelessness/housing insecurity and neighborhood/built environment predominating. Machine learning (ML) techniques were used in 23 of 26 studies, with natural language processing (NLP) being the most commonly used approach (n=11). Rule-based NLP (n=5), deep learning (n=2), and pattern matching (n=4) were the most commonly used NLP techniques. NLP models in the reviewed studies displayed significant predictive performance with outcomes, with F1-scores ranging between 0.40 and 0.75 and specificities nearing 95.9%. Conclusions: Although in its infancy, the convergence of AI and data science techniques, especially ML and NLP, with SDOH in EM offers transformative possibilities for better usage and integration of social data into clinical care and research. With a significant focus on the ED and notable NLP model performance, there is an imperative to standardize SDOH data collection, refine algorithms for diverse patient groups, and champion interdisciplinary synergies. These efforts aim to harness SDOH data optimally, enhancing patient care and mitigating health disparities. Our research underscores the vital need for continued investigation in this domain. ¬© Ethan E Abbott, Donald Apakama, Lynne D Richardson, Lili Chan, Girish N Nadkarni.',\n",

However, despite the increasing popularity of TGDS, there is a lack of studies comparing TGDS methods on concrete data science tasks, and their deployment remains difficult. To address this gap, we present a comparative study of existing TGDS paradigms applied to time-series prediction, in the context of dynamical systems modeling. Our concrete use case is lithium-ion battery modeling. Applying TG DS paradigms in this context is not trivial, and we describe how to organize existing domain knowledge and to implement the TGDS paradigms. We uniquely introduce and evaluate essential criteria for TGDS methods (domain knowledge and intellectual effort), often missing in use-case-specific publications. Our study findings reveal that while effective TGDS methods require substantial domain knowledge, their implementation does not necessarily require significant effort. ¬© 2024 IEEE.',\n",

Since Logica is built on top of mature SQL implementations, these features can be executed robustly and scalably. Logica allows beginners to seamlessly progress from simple textbook examples to intermediate and advanced use cases. We introduce Logica with examples that combine aggregation, recursion, and negation in interesting and powerful ways. Additional advanced examples (maximum flow, matrix inversion, etc.) are demonstrated in an online notebook.

Design/methodology/approach: The development of the CoDS framework is grounded on the design science research methodology for information systems research. In our case study, we first designed the initial framework for CoDS based on a systematic literature review. Then, we collected the expert opinions of eight data scientists to validate the need for generic content for such a knowledge management system. In the second iteration, a portfolio prototype is developed by the same data scientists as a part of our technical action research. Finally, a survey is conducted with 57 data analyst candidates in the last iteration. Findings: Using the CoDS portfolio strengthened the communication among data scientists and stakeholders to improve development and scaling activities.

In this paper, we present a data science solution that integrates weather data with historical energy consumption data for energy consumption analysis. Consequently, the solution predicts temporal energy consumption patterns via techniques like frequent pattern mining, traditional machine learning, and deep learning. Our solution integrates meteorological and environmental conditions over time series, analyzes them, forecasts energy consumption, and examines how weather conditions affect energy usage variation. Evaluation results on a real-world dataset show that our solution identifies several distinct frequent patterns with frequent pattern mining, and it reveals a significant relationship between irradiance and energy consumption, as well as a positive correlation between temperature and energy usage. Moreover, our solution predicts and compares energy consumption for a specific year using linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting models with daily weather data. Additionally, we applied a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to analyze energy consumption as time-series data, uncovering patterns based on given time steps.

       " 'This paper presents a data-driven approach using machine learning to create a model for predicting the behavior of the cementation exponent \"m\" (it is a function of the shape and distribution of pores) in Mexican Naturally Fractured Reservoirs (NFRs), aiming to reduce uncertainty in reserves calculations and risks on decision-making for wells lacking core data information. The purpose is to predict \"m\" with limited measurements by machine learning models trained with core data and special logs from key wells. Different authors have addressed the ranges of \"m\" based on the type of porosity or rock texture; however, most of these studies are not from Mexican fields. Information was compiled from 1,154 data points obtained from cores in different porous systems, including matrix, fractures, unconnected vugs, and connected vugs. Probabilistic and statistical theorems were used to handle complex and nonlinear relationships between porosity and the cementation exponent \"m\". Data science revealed patterns that were not evident or were influenced by multiple factors. Finally, test examples of partitioned porosity data and several measured cementation exponent core well data have been provided to verify the effectiveness and adaptability for the determination of the cementation exponent \"m\" through the so-called SPP (Statistical Porosity Partitioning) method. This also provides algorithm support for different porous systems (matrix, fractures and vugs), achieving a MAAPE (Mean Arctangent Absolute Percentage Error) of 0.22 between the originals and the predicted values. The first example applying the SPP method is through the development of an equation to analyze a triple-porosity NFR (intergranular, vugs and fractures), successfully predicting the porosity exponent, with an accuracy of around 70% compared to the core-measured data. The second example demonstrates the success of the equation\\'s performance in a dual-porosity NFR (matrix-fractures). Next, the third example was conducted in a well with connected vugs and matrix, achieving a 100% prediction accuracy of the cementation exponent \"m\" value compared to the core-measured data. Finally, the fourth case shows an example of an exploratory well without any core analysis, and the results of applying our model achieved a better understanding of the reservoir behavior. The input features for cementation exponent identification are effective porosity and discrete porous system log, with resulting values of 1, 2, 3, and 4, depending on the type of NFR present. The SPP method was then applied to wells lacking specific core information to obtain a cementation exponent \"m\" exclusively for naturally fractured reservoirs (NFR), thus reducing uncertainty in estimation of hydrocarbon reserves.

The use of routinely collected data to produce real-world evidence, as an alternative to clinical trials, has been gaining in popularity as the availability and quality of digital health platforms grow and the linkage landscape, and the analytics required to make best use of linked and unstructured data, is rapidly evolving. Capitalising on existing data sources, innovative linkage and advanced analytic approaches provides the opportunity to undertake novel injury prevention research and generate new knowledge, while avoiding data waste and additional burden to participants. We provide a tangible, but not exhaustive, list of examples showing the breadth and value of data linkage, along with the emerging capabilities of natural language processing techniques to enhance injury research. To optimise data science approaches to injury prevention, injury researchers in this area need to share methods, code, models and tools to improve consistence and efficiencies in this field.

Multicenter observational research could address many of those concerns, especially in hand surgery where multicenter research is currently quite limited; however, there are numerous barriers including regulatory issues, lack of common terminology, and variable data set structures. The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) program aims to surmount these limitations by enabling large-scale, collaborative research across multiple institutions. The OHDSI uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to standardize health care data into a common language, enabling consistent and reliable analysis. The OMOP CDM has been transformative in converting multiple databases into a standardized code with a single vocabulary, allowing for coherent analysis across multiple data sets. Building upon the OMOP CDM, OHDSI provides an extensive suite of open-source tools for all research stages, from data extraction to statistical modeling. By keeping sensitive data local and only sharing summary statistics, OHDSI ensures compliance with privacy regulations while allowing for large-scale analyses.

The current study seeks to anticipate and delineate the assessments offered by both parents and teachers concerning a child‚Äôs behavior and overall functioning with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-2 (BRIEF-2). Mothers, fathers, and teachers of 59 children diagnosed or in the process of being assessed for ADHD participated in this study. The responses provided by 59 mothers, 59 fathers, and 57 teachers to the BRIEF-2 questionnaire were collected. The performance of various feature selection techniques, including Lasso, decision trees, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and forward stepwise regression, was evaluated. The results indicate that Lasso stands out as the optimal method for our dataset, striking an ideal balance between accuracy and interpretability. A repeated validation analysis reveals an average positive correlation exceeding 0.5 between the inattention/hyperactivity scores reported by informants (mother, father, or teacher) and the predictions derived from Lasso. This performance is achieved using only approximately 18% of the BRIEF-2 items. These findings underscore the usefulness of variable selection techniques in accurately characterizing a patient‚Äôs condition while employing a small subset of assessment items. This efficiency is particularly valuable in time-constrained settings and contributes to improving the comprehension of ADHD. ¬© 2024 the author(s),',\n",

However, these skills are not routinely taught, representing a growing unmet educational need. This education report presents a structured short course that was run to teach clinicians data science and the lessons learnt. Methods: A 1-day introductory course was conducted within a tertiary hospital in London. It consisted of lectures followed by facilitated pair programming exercises in R, an object-oriented programming language. Feedback was collated and participant responses were graded using a Likert scale. Results: The course was attended by 20 participants. The majority of participants (69%) were in higher speciality cardiology training. While more than half of the participants (56%) received prior training in statistics either through formal taught programmes (e.g., a Master‚Äôs degree) or online courses, the participants reported several barriers to expanding their skills in data science due to limited programming skills, lack of dedicated time, training opportunities and awareness.

       " 'With unprecedented and growing interest in data science education, there are limited educator materials that provide meaningful opportunities for learners to practice statistical thinking, as defined by Wild and Pfannkuch, with messy data addressing real-world challenges. As a solution, Nolan and Speed advocated for bringing applications to the forefront in undergraduate statistics curriculum with the use of in-depth case studies to encourage and develop statistical thinking in the classroom. Limitations to this approach include the significant time investment required to develop a case study‚Äînamely, to select a motivating question and to create an illustrative data analysis‚Äîand the domain expertise needed. As a result, case studies based on realistic challenges, not toy examples, are scarce. To address this, we developed the Open Case Studies (opencasestudies.org) project, which offers a new statistical and data science education case study model. This educational resource provides self-contained, multimodal, peer-reviewed, and open-source guides (or case studies) from real-world examples for active experiences of complete data analyses. We developed an educator‚Äôs guide describing how to most effectively use the case studies, how to modify and adapt components of the case studies in the classroom, and how to contribute new case studies (opencasestudies.org/OCS_Guide). ¬© 2024 The Author(s).

       " 'Background: Learning and teaching interdisciplinary health data science (HDS) is highly challenging, and despite the growing interest in HDS education, little is known about the learning experiences and preferences of HDS students. Objective: We conducted a systematic review to identify learning preferences and strategies in the HDS discipline. Methods: We searched 10 bibliographic databases (PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Wiley Online Library, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, EBSCOhost, ERIC, and IEEE Xplore) from the date of inception until June 2023. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and included primary studies written in English that investigated the learning preferences or strategies of students in HDS-related disciplines, such as bioinformatics, at any academic level. Risk of bias was independently assessed by 2 screeners using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, and we used narrative data synthesis to present the study results. Results: After abstract screening and full-text reviewing of the 849 papers retrieved from the databases, 8 (0.9%) studies, published between 2009 and 2021, were selected for narrative synthesis. The majority of these papers (7/8, 88%) investigated learning preferences, while only 1 (12%) paper studied learning strategies in HDS courses. The systematic review revealed that most HDS learners prefer visual presentations as their primary learning input. In terms of learning process and organization, they mostly tend to follow logical, linear, and sequential steps. Moreover, they focus more on abstract information, rather than detailed and concrete information. Regarding collaboration, HDS students sometimes prefer teamwork, and sometimes they prefer to work alone. Conclusions: The studies‚Äô quality, assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, ranged between 73% and 100%, indicating excellent quality overall. However, the number of studies in this area is small, and the results of all studies are based on self-reported data. Therefore, more research needs to be conducted to provide insight into HDS education. We provide some suggestions, such as using learning analytics and educational data mining methods, for conducting future research to address gaps in the literature. We also discuss implications for HDS educators, and we make recommendations for HDS course design; for example, we recommend including visual materials, such as diagrams and videos, and offering step-by-step instructions for students. ¬© 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

       " 'The advent of the Big Data era has necessitated a transformational shift in statistical research, responding to the novel demands of data science. Despite extensive discourse within statistical communities on confronting these emerging challenges, we offer our unique perspectives, underscoring the extended responsibilities of statisticians in pre-analysis and post-analysis tasks. Moreover, we propose a new definition and classification of Big Data based on data sources: Type I Big Data, which is the result of aggregating a large number of small datasets via data sharing and curation, and Type II Big Data, which is the Real-World Data (RWD) amassed from business operations and practices. Each category necessitates distinct data preprocessing and preparation (DPP) methods, and the objectives of analysis as well as the interpretation of results can significantly diverge between these two types of Big Data. We further suggest that the statistical communities should consider adopting and rapidly incorporating new paradigms and cultures by learning from other disciplines. Particularly, beyond Breiman‚Äôs (Stat Sci 16(3):199‚Äì231, 2021) two modeling cultures, statisticians may need to pay more attention to a newly emerging third culture: the integration of algorithmic modeling with multi-scale dynamic modeling based on fundamental physics laws or mechanisms that generate the data.

       " 'Implementing artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science holds significant potential for optimizing Midstream and Downstream operations in the petroleum industry, fostering margin enhancement opportunities and overall value chain optimization. This involves streamlining processes such as production, logistics, pipeline monitoring, refinery operations, plant safety, and environmental impact reduction. Artificial intelligence involves developing intelligent systems that operate autonomously, learn from experiences, and improve performance with increasing knowledge. On the other hand, data science focuses on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data to drive valuable insights. In the midstream stage, which pertains to crude or refined petroleum transportation, digital twin technology plays a crucial role, offering applications like pipeline monitoring and logistics optimization. Downstream is the refinery, processing and purifying of crude oil and natural gas. Companies like Shell and Chevron leverage in real-time data from sensors, cameras, and drones to create dynamic representations of operations and equipment for real-time monitoring and analysis. However, maintaining accurate and up-to-date digital twin models poses challenges. This is where AI techniques like optimization (model creation and updating), generative modelling, data analytics, predictive analytics, and decision-making come to play. For instance, according to Abn resource, Shell Lubricants introduced the AI-powered Chatbot tool, Shell LubeChat, in 2018, enhancing customer service for business-to-business lubricant clients and optimizing profits.

       " 'Generative Artificial Intelligence, also known as Generative AI has enhanced the capabilities of what is known to be AI to the world by its capability to generate text, image, or other forms of media through the extensive use of Large Language Models (LLMs). While the roots of LLM can be traced back to the Markovian theories proposed in 1906, Generative AI is the outcome of advancements in transformer-based deep neural networks which extend the machine learning paradigm. Fundamentally, there is a definitive need to store, manage, and use data to generate data that matches consumer needs. Generative AI-based tools today free users from the need to master programming language. This has paved the way for easy access to data generation, analytics, and subsequent dissemination of findings as per the consumer‚Äôs needs, often with or without a subscription fee. The ethical frameworks of AI are built on the four key principles, namely, beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice. In recent years, explicability, which incorporates intelligibility and accountability, was added as the fifth crucial principle in the framework. The use of AI by organizations have also led to reputational, regulatory, and legal risks, resulting in widespread discussions on Ethical AI or the ethical use of AI. In India, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR, India) has released guidelines for the Ethical Use of AI in Healthcare. Protecting data privacy at the individual (or citizen) level has been one of the crucial challenges in the healthcare sector. With the advent of Generative AI, these challenges have also experienced a multiplicative effect. In addition, the post-COVID-19 era has led to increased use of digital health technologies, fueling data privacy and security risks apart from misinformation (leading to infodemics) and bias. Such concerns often affect developing countries, especially in the healthcare sector. The present research provides a state-of-the-art review of the ethical frameworks for Generative AI in healthcare. The study also provides an overview of privacy-preserving Generative AI paradigms, enabling the policy-makers (government, private, and other not-for-profit entities) to plan, propose, and disseminate policies that preserve the privacy of the data shared at an individual level. The study will benefit researchers by developing methodologies that align with the ethical framework for Generative AI, thus aligning with the principles of using AI for Good. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.',\n",

More precisely, we demonstrate that the training of self-organizing maps is an approximation to the training of Gaussian Mixture Models by gradient descent. As a consequence, the scores of a trained SOM can be treated as log-likelihoods of a GMM with tied, spherical covariance and used, e.g., for outlier detection, whereas sampling from trained SOMs is not well-defined. Furthermore, we outline how SGD-trained GMMs can be generalized to diagonal and more expressive covariance matrices and how this benefits typical data science applications such as outlier detection, sampling and generative classification.

In the field of large language models, we find there is no one-size-fits-all model which satisfies the needs of other scientists. There are differences in the soft results which may be a limitation on their application. To analyze these differences and lack of robustness, we propose a robust methodology that integrates classical statistical experimental design principles with the these advanced models, aiming to identify statistically significant differences among their outcomes. In particular, an experimental design is presented in which the main factors, levels, treatments and interactions that influence the predictions made by different models of complex natural language processing are identified. The main aim of this research is to better understand the influence of some controlled factors that are used in com-plex natural language processing models by applying classical statistical techniques, providing a comprehensive perspective on the relative effectiveness of different zero-shot classification models. It aims to offer practitioners insights into when and where certain models may be more or less sensitive, facilitating informed decision-making in applying these advanced language models.

The authors present problems of validity, reliability, and significance and provide common solutions based on statistical methodology to solve them. The book focuses on model-based empirical methods where data annotations and model predictions are treated as training data for interpretable probabilistic models from the well-understood families of generalized additive models (GAMs) and linear mixed effects models (LMEMs). Based on the interpretable parameters of the trained GAMs or LMEMs, the book presents model-based statistical tests such as a validity test that allows for the detection of circular features that circumvent learning. Furthermore, the book discusses a reliability coefficient using variance decomposition based on random effect parameters of LMEMs. Lastly, a significance test based on the likelihood ratios of nested LMEMs trained on the performance scores of two machine learning models is shown to naturally allow the inclusion of variations in meta-parameter settings into hypothesis testing, and further facilitates a refined system comparison conditional on properties of input data. The book is self-contained with an appendix on the mathematical background of generalized additive models and linear mixed effects models as well as an accompanying webpage with the related R and Python code to replicate the presented experiments. The second edition also features a new hands-on chapter that illustrates how to use the included tools in practical applications. ¬© The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s).',\n",

       " \"The complexity and size of biological datasets have led to an exponential increase in the demand for advanced data analysis tools in biological research. Traditional statistical methods and machine learning algorithms usually fail to capture complicated patterns in these datasets. The paper fills that gap by proposing a novel deep learning-based method for mining biological data. The suggested method overcomes the constraints of existing systems by utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to extract hierarchical features and temporal correlations, respectively. Preprocessing techniques, supervised learning, transfer learning, and ensemble procedures are utilized to boost the system's accuracy (0.95), precision (0.94), recall (0.96), and F1score (0.95) when compared to other systems. The results indicate significant gains in accuracy across a variety of datasets, with the proposed system displaying computational efficiency, training in 8 hours and inference in 1 second, versus 15 hours and 5 seconds for conventional systems. The study underlines the critical need for new approaches in the field, as well as the transformational potential of the suggested system to accelerate medical, genetic, and biotechnology discoveries. ¬© 2024 IEEE.\",\n",

With the goal of recommending services to consumers that are highly relevant to their interests, this study primarily aims to facilitate service consumption for individual usage. In the future, when it comes to service composition, it will be possible to suggest services that connect certain points in a planned process with suitable services. In order to enhance the Web service discovery process, it is possible to conduct a thorough evaluation of Wikipedia's usefulness as a source of semantics. Service quality forecasting in a mobile computing context is complicated and requires attention. The cloud environment can easily accommodate the requested tasks. A cloud provider's implicit and explicit data may be used to find the right services for a company's processes. The relationships between services may also be deduced from the messages exchanged in the cloud. Last but not least, we present and implement a new architectural model for service selection systems that makes use of implicit feedbacks, suggests a CF-based service selection algorithm that takes into account user requirements during the ranking process, and employs the proposed Web service technique, support-based kernel, and enhanced vector-based ranking method. By taking into account the interests of all other users, the suggested model is able to solve the cold start issue for new users and new services. We proposed data science approach (WSDS) allows us to provide a tailored way for predicting the quality of service (QoS) of online services. We create a homomorphic hash-based user verification method and use the Byzantine agreement to weed out untrustworthy individuals. Next, we assess the suggested WSDS on a dataset of actual web services, and we use matrix factorization to improve prediction accuracy.

This expertise plays a crucial role in analyzing data sets of different sizes in various application contexts. Given the increasing demand for bringing these skills together in the work environment, which is characterized by an insufficient number of highly skilled individuals, smart solutions are being developed to strengthen these competencies. This study investigates the integration of data science competencies in the architecture of modern automation frameworks (AutoFM). In this way, it aims to encourage a discussion on the potential of these systems to facilitate the acquisition of data science skills by individuals, thus contributing to a broader discourse on workforce empowerment. For this purpose, a systematic literature search according to Webster and Watson was conducted to identify suitable automation frameworks corresponding to the data science competencies. Using the method of qualitative content analysis, the automation frameworks AutoPrep, AutoGluon-Tabular, AutoClust, and DeepEye were examined and interpreted to determine which of the functions mentioned could represent skills from the EDISON Data Science competence framework. The results show that the AutoFMs theoretically cover characteristics of the required skills of a data scientist such as data visualization in some competence groups, but cannot cover the entire competence. Some skills can therefore be performed by AutoFMs in an interaction between humans and technology, while other skills are not yet supported. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.\",\n",

       " 'Data sources are the raw information that is required for analysis and modeling in data sciences. They assist data scientists in making proper conclusions, proving hypotheses, and making rational decisions. It is always preferable if analytical results can be obtained from multiple reliable sources. Thus, it is essential to assess such data sources in data sciences about various critical characteristics and factors. Nevertheless, the application of all-inclusive multi-attribute decision-making methodologies for the selection of data sources for integration has not received adequate attention in the existing literature and research. Thus, this article explains a new multi-attribute decision-making method through the model of the complex hesitant fuzzy rough set, which is the complex hesitant fuzzy rough multi-attribute decision-making method. This methodology would handle the evaluated values of attributes that have uncertainty, hesitancy, and roughness altogether. Besides, this study introduces several properties of complex hesitant fuzzy rough sets and develops several aggregation operators in the framework of complex hesitant fuzzy rough set and their properties. Subsequently, a case study of data source selection in data science is explained to explain the relevance of the developed multi-attribute decision-making framework in data sciences. Finally, the comparison of the devised theory with prevailing theories is interpreted. ¬© 2013 IEEE.',\n",

The safety and control of this fast-paced progress cannot be ensured without global governance, and the need for global regulation is becoming more and more visible. However, global rule-making raises additional ethical dilemmas that require the cooperation of not only politicians and legal experts, but also IT professionals and data science specialists to be solved. Understanding the ethical views and commitment of information system and AI development experts, especially those from the data science field is crucial for governmental actors in their efforts to bring AI under control. Furthermore, universities with data science programs need to be aware of this unfolding challenge. The research reported here investigated two groups of data science students - both full-time students and postgraduate students with substantial work experience - to shad light on their views and commitment to AI and data related ethical standards. The key finding indicates that while students expect governments and regulatory agencies to take charge in forming (global) AI policies, they consider themselves and their employers to be responsible for implementing and adhering to them. ¬© 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.',\n",

This study seeks to extend the power of pretraining methodologies to facilitating the prediction over tables in data science, a domain traditionally overlooked, yet inherently challenging due to the plethora of table schemas intrinsic to different tasks. The primary research questions underpinning this work revolve around the establishment of a universal pretraining protocol for tables with varied structures, the generalizability and transferability of learned knowledge across tasks, the adaptation to diverse downstream applications, and the incorporation of incremental columns over time. In response to these challenges, we introduce UniTabE, a straightforward yet effective method designed to process tables in a uniform manner, devoid of constraints imposed by specific table structures. UniTabE's core concept relies on representing each basic table element with a module, termed TabUnit. This is subsequently followed by a Transformer encoder to refine the representation. Moreover, our model is designed to facilitate pretraining and finetuning through the utilization of free-form prompts. In order to implement the pretraining phase, we curated an expansive tabular dataset comprising approximately 13 billion samples, meticulously gathered from the Kaggle platform. This research primarily centers on classification and regression tasks involving tabular data, and conducts rigorous experimental testing and analyses to validate the effectiveness of our methodology. The experimental results demonstrate UniTabE's superior performance against several baseline models across a multitude of benchmark datasets. This, therefore, underscores UniTabE's potential to significantly enhance the semantic representation of tabular data, thereby marking a significant stride for tabular data analysis. ¬© 2024 12th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024.

       " 'In recent years, we have witnessed the growing interest from academia and industry in applying data science technologies to analyze large amounts of data. In this process, a myriad of artifacts (datasets, pipeline scripts, etc.) are created. However, there has been no systematic attempt to holistically collect and exploit all the knowledge and experiences that are implicitly contained in those artifacts. Instead, data scientists recover information and expertise from colleagues or learn via trial and error. Hence, this paper presents a scalable platform, KGLiDS, that employs machine learning and knowledge graph technologies to abstract and capture the semantics of data science artifacts and their connections. Based on this information, KGLiDS enables various downstream applications, such as data discovery and pipeline automation. Our comprehensive evaluation covers use cases in data discovery, data cleaning, transformation, and AutoML. It shows that KGLiDS is significantly faster with a lower memory footprint than the state-of-the-art systems while achieving comparable or better accuracy. ¬© 2024 IEEE.',\n",
       " \"Integrated factory design (IFD) requires cross-disciplinary competences obtained inter alia from areas of industrial, mechanical, civil engineering and architecture as well as operations, assets and facility management. However, traditional teaching practices in higher education could neither effectively provide solutions to cross-disciplinary competencies for IFD nor supply evolving job market demands (aka skill gaps). Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are pivotal in this transformation, shaping smart learning environments that integrate collaborative activities and harness freely available online tools and cloud services. However, challenges persist in cross-disciplinary fields like IFD, where data science and visualization technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) are increasingly applied but often not fully integrated into traditional curricula. To address this educational gap, this paper introduces the digiTeachVR platform, which incorporates VR and data science into a collaborative teaching platform designed for IFD. Undergraduate and graduate students from diverse disciplines participate in a parametric design course that leverages industrial data science and VR within an interactive, self-paced, collaborative environment. The digiTeachVR's approach involves self-taught programming lessons followed by collaborative programming on Python. This is to develop parametric designs, subsequently transformed into VR models using Rhino 3D. A pilot study of digiTeachVR at the TU Wien indicates a significant (79%) increase in student enthusiasm, suggesting improved content delivery and enhanced learning outcomes (63%).

       " 'Data science pipelines commonly utilize dataframe and array operations for tasks such as data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning. The most popular tools for these tasks are pandas and NumPy. However, these tools are limited to executing on a single node, making them unsuitable for processing large-scale data. Several systems have attempted to distribute data science applications to clusters while maintaining interfaces similar to single-node libraries, enabling data scientists to scale their workloads without significant effort. However, existing systems often struggle with processing large datasets due to Out-of-Memory (OOM) problems caused by poor data partitioning. To overcome these challenges, we develop Xorbits, a high-performance, scalable data science framework specifically designed to distribute data science workloads across clusters while retaining familiar APIs. The key differentiator of Xorbits is its ability to dynamically switch between graph construction and graph execution. Xorbits has been successfully deployed in production environments with up to 5k CPU cores. Its applications span various domains, including user behavior analysis and recommendation systems in the e-commerce sector, as well as credit assessment and risk management in the finance industry. Users can easily scale their data science workloads by simply changing the import line of their pandas and NumPy code. Our experiments demonstrate that Xorbits can effectively process very large datasets without encountering OOM or data-skewing problems. Over the fastest state-of-the-art solutions, Xorbits achieves an impressive 2.66 √ó speedup on average. In terms of API coverage, Xorbits attains a compatibility rate of 96.7%, surpassing the fastest framework by an impressive margin of 60 percentage points.

Experiments are conducted to compare these architecture patterns with workloads of volume and velocity criteria. Orchestrator pattern performs best and could be used for inference, while choreography pattern could be used for training of machine learning models due to asynchronous communication.

A bibliometric analysis (BA) of scientific articles, technological developments, and patents in different sources of web information was implemented. Additionally, search algorithms and DS were designed to perform an analysis of trends from social media platforms in the avocado value chain. The BA identified patters associated with the avocado chain in Colombia, highlighting the increase in scientific-technical information, the grouping by work networks, the bias associated with departments and commercial varieties such as the high volume of works in Antioquia and cv. Hass, and the few high-value alternatives for the chain such as patents, industrial secrets, etc. Trends in social networks were linked to international markets, added value, and environmental aspects. Likewise, a disconnection was found between the needs of the avocado value chain and the existing offers. This study contributes as a competitive strategy for the local avocado subsector and generates a country-adjusted research agenda. ¬© This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, as long as the original work is properly cited.',\n",

Simultaneously, there has been clear guidance written on curriculum development for both data science (De Veaux et\\xa0al.) and statistics (Carver et\\xa0al.) programs. While this was occurring, ABET (now simply an acronym, but previously standing for the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology), in coordination with organizations such as the American Statistical Association, developed accreditation criteria for Data Science programs. In this article, we discuss our journey through ABET accreditation and discuss how adopting ABET processes for continuous improvement strengthens a program‚Äôs assessment process. We share best practices for working across multiple departments to collect data not only on individual courses, but also on the program as a whole. While the framework presented was initially established to support ABET accreditation, we argue that a properly executed program assessment should occur regardless of whether or not an institution is seeking ABET accreditation for their data science program. Throughout this article, we also discuss the extent to which ABET requirements naturally fit within our program‚Äôs existing goals, including an assessment of how ABET requirements align with major ideas in the field of data science education. ¬© This work was authored as part of the Contributor‚Äôs official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

       " 'Context: Epilepsy is a common neurological disease and is classified into different types based on features such as the kind of seizure, age of onset, part of brain effected, etc. There are nearly 30 approved anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) for treating different epilepsies and each drug targets proteins exhibiting a specific molecular mechanism of action. There are many genes, proteins, and microRNAs known to be associated with different epileptic disorders. This rich information on epilepsy-associated data is not available at one single location and is scattered across multiple publicly available repositories. There is a need to have a single platform integrated with the data, as well as tools required for epilepsy research. Methods and Material: Text mining approaches are used to extract data from multiple biological sources. The data is curated and populated within an in-house developed epilepsy database. Machine-learning based models are built in-house to know the probability of a protein being druggable based on the significant protein features. A web interface is provided for the access of the epilepsy database as well as the ML-based tool developed in-house. Results: The epilepsy-associated data is made accessible through a web browser. For a protein of interest, the platform provides all the feature values, and the results generated using different machine learning models are displayed as visualization plots.

To solve this problem, it is widely accepted that fundamental support can be provided by the knowledge of how data are altered in the pre-processing phase, using data provenance to track such changes. This paper focuses on the design and development of a system for collecting and managing data provenance of data preparation pipelines in data science. An investigation of publicly available machine learning pipelines is conducted to identify the most important features required for the tool to achieve impact on a broad selection of preprocessing data manipulation.

It moves beyond pure data exploration to the organization of observations into meaningful groups, i.e., spatial clustering. This constitutes an important component of so-called unsupervised learning, a major aspect of modern machine learning. The distinctive aspects of the book are both to explore ways to spatialize classic clustering methods through linked maps and graphs, as well as the explicit introduction of spatial contiguity constraints into clustering algorithms. Leveraging a large number of real-world empirical illustrations, readers will gain an understanding of the main concepts and techniques and their relative advantages and disadvantages. The book also constitutes the definitive user‚Äôs guide for these methods as implemented in the GeoDa open source software for spatial analysis. It is organized into three major parts, dealing with dimension reduction (principal components, multidimensional scaling, stochastic network embedding), classic clustering methods (hierarchical clustering, k-means, k-medians, k-medoids and spectral clustering), and spatially constrained clustering methods (both hierarchical and partitioning). It closes with an assessment of spatial and non-spatial cluster properties. The book is intended for readers interested in going beyond simple mapping of geographical data to gain insight into interesting patterns as expressed in spatial clusters of observations.

       " 'In contemporary warfare, data science is crucial for the military in achieving information superiority. To gain an overview of the topic, 158 peer-reviewed articles were analysed through a semi-systematic literature review. The proportion of social science literature with a focus on risks of data science implies that policymakers are disproportionally influenced by a pessimistic view on military data science. The perceived risks of data science, however, are hardly addressed in formal science literature. Additionally, when levels of war are taken into account, relatively low attention for the operational level is observed. Literature reflects an emphasis on the tactical level when it comes to opportunities for military data science. On the contrary, studies examining the risks of military data science mostly consider the strategic level. Consequently, domain-specific requirements for military strategic data science may not be expressed. Lacking such applications ultimately leads to suboptimal strategic decisions in today‚Äôs warfare. ¬© 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

The first phase uses an exponential-based friction force model to identify the model parameters by an autoregressive model and Z-transform. The second phase uses symbolic regression for the residual analysis to enhance the friction force estimation. An empirical study of three types of CNC machines under different working conditions is conducted to validate the two-phase data science framework and identify the change of the machining displacement considered to be a critical factor affecting friction force. The exponential-based model successfully eliminates the circular spike error caused by the friction force in the tapping center machine. The results indicate that the proposed two-phase framework improves mean absolute error by 5.6% on average in the tapping center, 6.5% in the milling machine and 7.6% in the turning and milling center, respectively. ¬© 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

New optics, indicators, and experimental paradigms are now enabling in-vivo imaging from the synaptic to the cortex-wide scales. To match the resulting flood of data across scales, computational methods are continuously being developed to meet the need of extracting biologically relevant information. In this pursuit challenges arise in some domains (e.g., SNR and resolution limits in micron-scale data) that require specialized algorithms. These algorithms can, for example, make use of state-of-the-art machine learning to maximally learn the details of a given scale to optimize the processing pipeline. In contrast, other methods, however, such as graph signal processing, seek to abstract away from some of the details that are scale-specific to provide solution to specific sub-problems common across scales of neuroimaging.

The potency of AI and Data Science is deeply rooted in the successful resolution of these optimization problems, which are prevalent in areas such as machine learning model fine-tuning, operational research, and logistics. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that solutions to these optimization problems do not always come with guarantees. This does not necessarily imply that research is lacking in this direction. Instead, it is often a manifestation of the constraints imposed by the nature of the digital hardware used for calculations.

Existing DS process models, such as CRISP-DM, have limitations, resulting in low success rates for these undertakings. To address this issue, a novel methodology for the construction of patterns in DS project management has been proposed, using the Design Science Research methodology. The design draws inspiration from existing pattern concepts to address common problems in DS project execution. The methodology is demonstrated through the creation of patterns for best practices in DS project management, synthesized from scientific literature. The goal of this approach is to provide a platform for exchanging and standardizing best practices in DS project management. While initial demonstrations show the general applicability of the methodology, further evaluations and case studies are necessary to assess its effectiveness and areas for improvement. The study identifies potential ambiguities in certain activities within the process, suggesting opportunities for refinement.

       " 'The ethos surrounding data science as a sociotechnical phenomenon is multifaceted. The phenomenon embodies both advantageous and detrimental discourses. On the one hand, data science systems in healthcare offer novel technologies to help private and public institutions aid in better decision-making. On the other hand, facial recognition software often jeopardizes fundamental human rights with invasive and discriminatory algorithms. While making data science systems, practitioners are typically encouraged to execute project management methodology CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) to complete projects successfully. Created for data mining projects, CRISP-DM guides the management of data science projects with six phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. This work-in-progress conceptual paper uses an intersectional feminist framework to critically analyze CRISP-DM for data science projects. The reimagined intersectional CRISP-DM or InCRISP-DM methodology embraces iterative intersectional feminist interrogation to clarify six standard CRISP-DM workflow phases with four provocations: Learning & Praxis, Harm Reduction, Transformation and Accountability & Transparency. Future work appeals to bringing awareness of transnational risks that can emerge when applying western project management methodologies to countries of the Global South. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.',\n",

       " 'The evolution of industrial revolutions has been marked by the increasing use of data and information to improve productivity and efficiency. Industry 3.0 introduced automation and digitalization, which generated a lot of data from various sources and processes. This data was mainly used for monitoring and controlling the industrial activities, such as production, quality, and maintenance. Industry 4.0 leveraged this data to generate insights and intelligence, using technologies such as cloud computing, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies enabled the integration and communication of data across different levels and domains of the industrial system, such as machines, products, processes, and services. Industry 4.0 also introduced the concept of smart factories, which are self-organizing, adaptive, and learning systems that can optimize their performance and efficiency. Industry 5.0 aims to enable human-robot collaboration and artificial intelligence [1], creating a more personalized and sustainable industrial system. Industry 5.0 focuses on enhancing the human capabilities and creativity, rather than replacing them with machines. It also emphasizes the social and environmental aspects of industrial development, such as customer satisfaction, worker well-being, and resource conservation. Industry 5.0 envisions a human-centric and eco-friendly industrial paradigm, where humans and machines work together in harmony and synergy. One of the sectors that can benefit from the convergence of business intelligence (BI) and artificial intelligence (AI) is the energy industry, which faces challenges such as increasing demand, environmental regulations, and market volatility. By combining BI and AI, energy companies can unlock value from their data and optimize their operations, such as production, distribution, and consumption. BI helps energy companies to collect, store, analyze, and visualize data from various sources, such as sensors, meters, devices, and systems. BI enables energy companies to monitor and manage their assets, processes, and performance, as well as to identify and solve problems, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. AI helps energy companies to augment and automate their decision making, using techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. AI enables energy companies to generate predictions, recommendations, and insights from their data, as well as to optimize their operations, such as scheduling, dispatching, pricing, and trading. AI also helps energy companies to create new products and services, such as smart grids, smart meters, smart homes, and smart cities. By combining BI and AI, energy companies can create a data-driven and intelligent energy system, which can respond to the changing needs and preferences of customers, stakeholders, and regulators, as well as to the dynamic and uncertain market conditions.

       " \"Delivering a data science project encompasses several hurdles that need to be addressed. As the project matures, the business requirements may change over time. In addition, uncertainties associated with data integrity, quantity, and quality can have an impact on the success of the project. The effectiveness of advanced analytics and algorithms that is changing depending on the complexity of the project and ambiguities in project values potentially will lead to adverse effects on deliverables and task prioritization. Agile-scrum framework enables projects with time-boxed iterations (sprints). It also introduces delivery through increments (MVPs) that assist in reaching the overall aim or vision of the product. However, backlog prioritization and sequence of tasks is not bounded by any criteria and depends fully on product owner's understanding of product goal and value. On the other hand, CRISP-DM is a solid place to start for advising developers on the steps and tasks needed to build a data science product. It enables exploratory and discovery work through iterations to satisfy the requirements of the data science project. However, the lack of time element within the process might cause infinite iterative cycles and delay delivery to customers. At Petronas, we have integrated a hybrid strategy that envelops the CRISP-DM process within defined time-limited sprints. The process flow from CRISP-DM can help to plan which tasks to be assigned in which sprint. Properly assigned scrum team roles will ensure proper establishment of scrum. Furthermore, conducting scrum events will enable effective and productive customers engagement. Periodic inspection of scrum artifacts will also ensure alignment with product goals. This hybrid approach demonstrates how the change in requirements can be strategically addressed by utilizing the Agile-Scrum CRISP-DM methodology while ensuring that the product goal is achieved. It also highlights how Agile-Scrum ensures successful delivery of product, maximizing product value, and customer satisfaction, while CRISP-DM can guide us in planning for data science project sprints.

       " 'Many-Objective Feature Selection (MOFS) approaches use four or more objectives to determine the relevance of a subset of features in a supervised learning task. As a consequence, MOFS typically returns a large set of non-dominated solutions, which have to be assessed by the data scientist in order to proceed with the final choice. Given the multi-variate nature of the assessment, which may include objectives (e.g., fairness) unrelated to predictive accuracy, this step is often not straightforward and suffers from the lack of existing tools. For instance, it is common to make use of a tabular presentation of the solutions, which provides little information about the trade-offs and the relationships between objectives over the set of solutions. Adopting a GA-based MOFS with six objectives (number of selected features, balanced accuracy, F1-Score, variance inflation factor, statistical parity, and equalised odds) for two feature selection tasks, this paper illustrates the complex challenge of assessing MOFS results and the need for a methodology to aid and justify the final choice of a solution. ¬© 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

First, a workflow for fatigue life prediction of flame-resistant magnesium alloy welded joints was proposed. The workflow consists of thermo-elastic-plastic analysis simulating welding, macroscopic stress field analysis to identify stress concentration zones, crack initiation analysis using crystal plasticity analysis and Tanaka-Mura model, and crack propagation analysis using finite element method and Paris‚Äô law. The fatigue life calculations were repeatedly performed by using the proposed workflow for different shapes of weld toe, excess weld metal and undercut, and the results were compiled into a database. A surrogate model was developed from the database by machine learning to predict the fatigue indicator parameter (FIP), which is an index of crack initiation life obtained by the Tanaka-Mura model. The effect of weld geometry on fatigue life was evaluated by exploring the surrogate model using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method.

Hence, this study implements a novel data science process to empirically model the daily reported cases and Google search queries in 14 countries. We observed a strong positive association (0.79-0.96) among reported cases of COVID-19 in the 14 countries. Furthermore, there is an inverse correlation of -0.18 to -0.62 between information diffusion on the virus and reported cases (new cases and deaths). Our outcome shows that contagious diseases are highly predictable using historical records from other countries and information spread on the disease. ¬© 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.',\n",

Addressing this gap, we developed the Health Gym project, a free and open-source platform designed to generate synthetic health data sets applicable to various areas of data science education, including machine learning, data visualization, and traditional statistical models. Initially, we generated 3 synthetic data sets for sepsis, acute hypotension, and antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. This paper discusses the educational applications of Health Gym's synthetic data sets. We illustrate this through their use in postgraduate health data science courses delivered by the University of New South Wales, Australia, and a Datathon event, involving academics, students, clinicians, and local health district professionals. We also include adaptable worked examples using our synthetic data sets, designed to enrich hands-on tutorial and workshop experiences. Although we highlight the potential of these data sets in advancing data science education and health care artificial intelligence, we also emphasize the need for continued research into the inherent limitations of synthetic data. ¬© 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

The Data Mine embodies data-infused education, research, and collaboration. Students learn Python, R, SQL, and shell-scripting, while working on weekly projects within a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. In the Corporate Partners cohort, students work on teams of 5‚Äì15 students, led by a paid student team leader. Each cohort follows an Agile approach, working on data-intensive projects provided by industry partners and mentored by company employees. Students develop professional and data skills throughout the academic year, from August through April. Many students return in subsequent years to the program, increasing their tenure with a Corporate Partner. Student teams are inherently interdisciplinary; students from 133 different majors are involved in the program, ranging from new incoming students through PhD level students. These interdisciplinary teams of students bring new perspectives to challenging problems in which data science is a key part of the solution. The interdisciplinary teams foster an environment of synthesis with ideas and solutions. Students come together with different life experiences, different levels of technical skill, but also varying ways they navigate paths to solutions because of the variety of majors represented, resulting in a more creative and robust solution than a traditional data science program.

Therefore, commercial banking system is increasingly moving towards international standards is a prerequisite to ensure the reduction of systemic risks in banking. Besides, commercial banks and the financial industry face considerable hurdles in light of the fourth Covid-19 outbreak. Commercial banks continuously put capital adequacy measures in place to fulfill Basel regulations. One of the main ways they do this is by issuing bonds, which boost tier 2 capital sources. This helps mobilize capital and assure capital safety for the market's borrowing requirements in the long run. As a result, considering both external and internal variables, this research seeks to investigate what influences the capital adequacy ratio of Vietnam's joint-stock commercial banks. Between 2011 and 2022, the authors combed through data from 25 different Vietnamese joint-stock commercial banks. The authors employed the system generalized method of moments model and other conventional techniques for panel data analysis. The study's findings had fourteen components affecting the capital adequacy ratio, with a significance of 0.01. Therefore, it is evident that the equity capital of Vietnamese commercial banks has successfully met the required safety standards for assets with credit risk as per legislation. As a result, this assists Vietnamese commercial banks in managing potential losses from credit activities, thus assuring the security of banking operations and protecting depositors.

Feature selection, enabled by RF, is often among the very first tasks in a data science project, such as the college capstone project, industry consulting projects. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of 12 RF-based feature selection methods for classification problems. The review provides necessary description of each method and the software packages. We show that different methods typically do not provide consistent feature selection results, and the model performance also varies when different RF-based feature selection approaches are employed. This observation suggests that caution must be taken when performing feature selection tasks using RF. Feature selection cannot be blindly done without a sound understanding of the methods adopted, which is not always the case in industry and many senior capstone projects that we have observed. The paper serves as a one-stop reference where students, data science consultants, engineers, and data scientists can access the basic ideas behind these methods, the advantages and limitations of different approaches, as well as the software packages to implement these methods. ¬© 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',\n",

       " 'Understanding, modeling, and predicting student performance in higher education poses significant challenges concerning the design of accurate and robust diagnostic models. While numerous studies attempted to develop intelligent classifiers for anticipating student achievement, they overlooked the importance of identifying the key factors that lead to the achieved performance. Such identification is essential to empower program leaders to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of their academic programs and thereby take the necessary corrective interventions to ameliorate student achievements. To this end, our paper contributes, to begin with, a hybrid approach of factor analysis that combines various data science approaches. The prediction of student performance is produced by combining baseline models, cross-validation, and factor analysis. We empirically investigate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our entire approach on four datasets. The experimental results show considerable improvements compared to single baseline models, demonstrating the practicality of the proposed approach in pinpointing multiple factors impacting student performance. The result proves that the hybrid algorithm combining cross-validation and factor analysis approaches yields results that are far superior in terms of achieving accuracy in prediction of academic performance of the students. The model may be successfully extended to other programs to predict the performance of the students. ¬© 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.',\n",

After mortality and during morbidity, relevant data about a health problem have been gathered. This massive amount of data in various forms needs to be handled for any healthcare issues are significant. With the growth of big data in healthcare communities, accurate analysis of medical data has the benefits of early disease detection, improved patient care, and effective community services. Because of its significance, there is a need to develop efficient and better-performing data analytics techniques and tools to analyze medical big data from the gene level to the clinical level. The purpose of data analytics in healthcare is to find new insights in data, at least partially automate tasks such as diagnosing, and to facilitate clinical decision-making. Also, healthcare analytics has the potential to reduce costs of treatment, predict outbreaks of disease, avoid preventable diseases, and improve the quality of life in general. The average human lifespan is increasing across the world population and the application of big data analytics in healthcare are increasing day by day. Different format of health data are used for different types of analyses. For example, IoT gadgets are used by certain patients and clinicians as wearable monitors to track heartbeat and temperature. This signal generated data should be carefully analyzed over time. Also, scans such as X-rays, magnetic resonance images (MRIs), and computed tomography (CAT) scans can be studied with different data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to visualize the insides of the body in depth. In addition, data on individual cases of disease are analyzed; data received as text must be sorted, categorized, and coded for statistical analysis; and data from surveys might need to be weighted to produce valid estimates for sampled populations. The number of resources healthcare professionals can obtain from their patients continues to increase. Since these data are normally in different formats and sizes, it can be difficult for analysis. However, the current focus is no longer on how big the data is, but how intelligently it is managed by data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms. This study examines analytical techniques for different forms of health-related data to generate comprehensive healthcare reports and transform them into relevant critical insights that can then be used to provide better care. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.',\n",

       " \"Profiling data by plotting distributions and analyzing summary statistics is a critical step throughout data analysis. Currently, this process is manual and tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays data distributions and summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one version updates reactively ('live') and the other updates only on demand ('dead'). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight discovery with 91% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than manual profiling code written by users. Participants found live updates intuitive and felt it helped them verify their transformations while those with on-demand profiles liked the ability to look at past visualizations.

       " 'Despite the elevated importance of Data Science in Statistics, there exists limited research investigating how students learn the computing concepts and skills necessary for carrying out data science tasks. Computer Science educators have investigated how students debug their own code and how students reason through foreign code. While these studies illuminate different aspects of students‚Äô programming behavior or conceptual understanding, a method has yet to be employed that can shed light on students‚Äô learning processes. This type of inquiry necessitates qualitative methods, which allow for a holistic description of the skills a student uses throughout the computing code they produce, the organization of these descriptions into themes, and a comparison of the emergent themes across students or across time. In this article we share how to conceptualize and carry out the qualitative coding process with students‚Äô computing code. Drawing on the Block Model to frame our analysis, we explore two types of research questions which could be posed about students‚Äô learning.

       " 'Social media platforms generate large amounts of data on user activities, including likes, shares, comments, and follows. In recent years, the importance of data analytics as a sub-field of machine learning has grown significantly as more organizations have recognized the potential benefits of using data to improve their operations and strategies. One of the primary ways in which graph data science can be applied to Twitter data analytics is through network analysis. A network is a set of nodes (users) that are connected by edges (interactions), and network analysis involves examining the structure and properties of these networks. This chapter is an attempt to perform data analytics on the Twitter data set using Neo4j-based network analysis. Neo4j is a graph database that is designed to handle complex and interconnected data. With its powerful graph-based data model and query language, Neo4j is an excellent tool for data analytics, allowing users to easily explore and analyze relationships between data points. Analyzing social media activities using graph data science can provide valuable insights into user behavior, preferences, and trends. The research outcome of this chapter is to analyze social media activities using graph data science. ¬© 2024 selection and editorial matter, Ankur Beohar, Ribu Mathew, Abhishek Kumar Upadhyay, and Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma -individual chapters, the contributors.

Processing voluminous and complex data sets are the primary focus of the field of machine learning (ML). ML aims to develop data-driven methods and computational algorithms that can learn to identify complex and non-linear patterns to understand and predict the relationships between variables by analysing extensive data. Although ML models provide the final output for predictions, several steps need to be performed to achieve accurate predictions. These steps, data pre-processing, feature selection, feature engineering and outlier removal, are all contained in this book. New models are also developed using existing ML architecture and learning theories to improve the performance of traditional ML models and handle small and big data without manual adjustments. This research-oriented book will help subsurface engineers, geophysicists, and geoscientists become familiar with data science and ML advances relevant to subsurface engineering. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of data-driven approaches for salt identification, seismic interpretation, estimating enhanced oil recovery factor, predicting pore fluid types, petrophysical property prediction, estimating pressure drop in pipelines, bubble point pressure prediction, enhancing drilling mud loss, smart well completion and synthetic well log predictions. ¬© 2024 Daniel Asante Otchere.',\n",
       " 'What is data science? The simplest definition to come up with is, it is the study of data. The real-world data is raw and data science uses tools and techniques to extract meaningful information from the raw data. It incorporates different fields such as statistics, mathematics, computer engineering, machine learning, data miming, and artificial intelligence to analyze large amount of data. Nowadays there are various applications available to automatically capture and store this large amount of data such as online system and payment portals. Organizations are overwhelmed with this huge data and want to make inferences as to enhance business and productivity also to give users a better experience. Data science is helping to reveal gaps and uncovering new patterns take it from health, medicine, finance to e-commerce. Data science is a broader term, which consider multiple challenges, such as capturing, cleaning and transforming data to finally make inferences from it. Whereas data mining is mainly about extracting knowledge and unknown patterns from the huge amount of data hence it is also called ‚Äúknowledge discovery process‚Äù. On the other hand, machine learning is an automated technique which uses complex algorithms for data processing and providing trained model output or we can say that it is a technique to train model on the given data and make predictions. Artificial Intelligence goes one step ahead and uses machine learning algorithm to make intelligent systems which can work on their own. These techniques have made data processing faster and much more efficient. It is because of different expertise required in this field, data science is showing strong growth. ¬© 2024 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.',\n",

Given their highly customizable and porous structures, metal‚Äìorganic frameworks- (MOFs) are considered as next-generation membrane materials that can bring about high separation performance and energy efficiency in various separation applications. Yet, the enormously large number of possible MOF structures necessitates the development and implementation of efficient modeling approaches to expedite the design, discovery, and selection of optimal MOF-based membranes via directing the experimental efforts, time, and resources to the potentially useful membrane materials. With the recent developments in the field of atomic simulations and artificial intelligence methods, a new era of membrane modeling has started.

We derive our recommendations from directed graphs of known analysis states, with two input sources: one manually curated from online data science tutorials, and another extracted through semi-automatic analysis of a corpus of over 6000 Jupyter notebooks. We validated Lodestar through three separate user studies: first a formative evaluation involving novices learning data science using the tool. We used the feedback from this study to improve the tool. This was followed by a summative study involving both new and returning participants from the formative evaluation to test the efficacy of our improvements.

Our proposed module is guided by active learning principles: In addition to lecture materials on variational inference, we provide an accompanying class activity, an R shiny app, and guided labs based on real data applications of logistic regression and clustering documents using Latent Dirichlet Allocation with R code. The main goal of our module is to expose students to a method that facilitates statistical modeling and inference with large datasets.

As a result, there is a growing body of research regarding how to teach interdisciplinary collaboration skills. However, much of the work evaluating methods of teaching statistics and data science collaboration relies primarily on self-reflection data. Additionally, prior research lacks detailed methods for assessing the quality of collaboration skills. In this case study, we present a method for teaching statistics and data science collaboration, a framework for identifying elements of effective collaboration, and a comparative case study to evaluate the collaboration skills of both a team of students and an experienced collaborator on two components of effective data science collaboration: structuring a collaboration meeting and communicating with a domain expert. Results show that the students could facilitate meetings and communicate comparably well to the experienced collaborator, but that the experienced collaborator was better able to facilitate meetings and communicate to develop strong relationships, an important element for high-quality and long-term collaboration. Further work is needed to generalize these findings to a larger population, but these results begin to inform the field regarding effective ways to teach specific data science collaboration skills. ¬© 2023 The Author(s).

       " 'In order to determine a suitable automobile insurance policy premium, one needs to take into account three factors: the risk associated with the drivers and cars on the policy, the operational costs associated with management of the policy and the desired profit margin. The premium should then be some function of these three values. We focus on risk assessment using a data science approach. Instead of using the traditional frequency and severity metrics, we instead predict the total claims that will be made by a new customer using historical data of current and past policies. Given multiple features of the policy (age and gender of drivers, value of car, previous accidents, etc.), one can potentially try to provide personalized insurance policies based specifically on these features as follows. We can compute the average claims made per year of all past and current policies with identical features and then take an average over these claim rates. Unfortunately there may not be sufficient samples to obtain a robust average. We can instead try to include policies that are ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to obtain sufficient samples for a robust average. We therefore face a trade-off between personalization (only using closely similar policies) and robustness (extending the domain far enough to capture sufficient samples). This is known as the bias‚Äìvariance trade-off. We model this problem and determine the optimal trade-off between the two (i.e., the balance that provides the highest prediction accuracy) and apply it to the claim rate prediction problem.

However, while these developments add new features to the recommendation systems, the question of whether a novel solution would excel in practice remains. Open innovation and crowdsourcing platforms are becoming an arena for designers to test their solutions in business competitions. We show how structural topical modeling identifies topical themes that improve contestant performance using forum message data during the competition period. Our topic modeling analysis identifies technological and business issues that emerge in recommendation system development. An econometric framework further investigates the link between topic distribution and performance. The multiperiod difference-in-differences estimator reports no significant statistical relation when linking all message communications to the performance. However, topic-dominant and topic-dispersed messages are both found to positively and significantly impact performance. Our result shows that structural topical modeling has an essential role to critically examine the most valuable message links to boost performance.

Scatterplots are useful for exploratory analysis, but can do much more than just identifying correlations. As data sets get larger and more complex, relying solely on ‚Äúeye power‚Äù alone may cause us to miss interesting associations, or worse, make wrong interpretations. We show that by combining scatterplots with statistical and logical reasoning (the sliding window and two-axis median bisection), we may identify interesting associations in a case study of Graduate Record Examination admission versus graduation outcomes, and whether low detectability of proteins in a biological sample are truly associated with low abundance. Due to subjective visual interpretability, we recommend graphing the data using a multitude of visual variables and graph types before concluding the absence of an association. Finally, even if associations are demonstrable, developing causal models that could explain the observed fuzziness and lack of apparent correlations in the scatterplot are helpful for better decision-making and interpretation. ¬© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.',\n",

Methods: The editors follow a systematic approach to gather relevant articles and select the best papers for the section. This year, they updated the query to incorporate the topic of telemedicine and removed search terms related to geographic information systems. The revised query resulted in a larger number of identified papers, necessitating the appointment of a third section editor to handle the increased workload. The editors narrowed the initial pool of articles to 15 candidate papers through a multi-stage selection process. At least seven independent reviews were collected for each candidate paper, and a selection meeting with the IMIA Yearbook editorial board led to the final selection of the best papers for the CIS section. Results: The query was carried out in mid-January 2023 and retrieved a deduplicated result set of 5,206 articles from 1,500 journals. This year, 15 papers were nominated as candidates, and four were finally selected as the best papers in the CIS section. Including telemedicine in the query resulted in a substantial increase in the number of papers found. The analysis highlights the growing convergence between clinical information systems and telemedicine, with mobile health (mHealth) technologies and data science applications gaining prominence. The selected candidate papers emphasize the practical impact of research efforts, focusing on patient-centric outcomes and benefits, including intelligent mobile health monitoring systems and AI-assisted decision-making in healthcare. Conclusions: Looking ahead, the field of CIS is expected to continue evolving, driven by advances in telemedicine, mHealth technologies, data science, and AI integration, leading to more efficient, patient-oriented, and intelligent healthcare systems and overall improvement of global healthcare outcomes. ¬© The Author(s) 2023.',\n",

The method is compatible with many druglike aryl halides and amines and can be executed using miniaturized high-throughput experimentation (HTE) techniques that enable the rapid production of high-quality, consistent data sets. In addition to exploring the substrate scope and executing late-stage library synthesis of an active pharmaceutical, we used miniaturized HTE to interrogate the performance of a library of ligands across multiple substrate combinations in parallel at multiple time points.

Due to this, emerging technologies such as big data, data science and artificial intelligence (ETs) have become an alternative in the project life cycle. This article aims to present a systematic review of the literature on the use of these technologies in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. A methodology of collection, purification, evaluation, bibliometric, and categorical analysis was used. A total of 224 articles were found, which, using the PRISMA method, finally generated 57 articles. The categorical analysis focused on determining the technologies used, the most common methodologies, the most-discussed project management areas, and the contributions to the AEC industry. The review found that there is international leadership by China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The type of research most used is quantitative. The areas of knowledge where ETs are most used are Cost, Quality, Time, and Scope. Finally, among the most outstanding contributions are as follows: prediction in the development of projects, the identification of critical factors, the detailed identification of risks, the optimization of planning, the automation of tasks, and the increase in efficiency; all of these to facilitate management decision making. ¬© 2023 by the authors.',\n",

       " 'Applications of graph theory exist in many science disciplines including chemistry, physics, medicine, and engineering. Since computational methods as well as computer-based approaches are less expensive and efficient, these techniques are very helpful to analyze chemical compounds. Chemical graph theory is a field that includes such kinds of analyses of chemical structures. Graph descriptors, also referred as topological indices, are graph invariants that help to study different structural properties of chemical substances. Such descriptors also aid to understand different activities related to chemical compounds. The main objective of this study is to find the best appropriate index to estimate the heat of formation of SF6. Initially, we compute degree-based topological indices, co-indices, and reverse indices for Sulfur hexafluoride. A similarity measure is used for feature selection. A network of the indices is constructed based on a similarity measure which is defined using Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation. Next, twenty-one subnetworks of the network consisting of highly similar indices, referred as modules, are captured. One module is containing 13 indices, three are containing 2 indices, and all the remaining modules are comprised of only one vertex. Hierarchical clustering is used to verify the detected modules. From each module one index, called master regulatory index (MRI), is selected for further study. Afterward, the thermodynamical measure heat of formation (HOF) is computed. A correlation analysis is done between each master regulatory index and heat of formation to capture any uncorrelated feature, if exists. Finally, mathematical formulations between each MRI and HOF are estimated. The best estimate is selected based on root mean squared error. ¬© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Societ√† Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'This groundbreaking book transcends traditional machine learning approaches by introducing information measurement methodologies that revolutionize the field. Stemming from a UC Berkeley seminar on experimental design for machine learning tasks, these techniques aim to overcome the \\'black box\\' approach of machine learning by reducing conjectures such as magic numbers (hyper-parameters) or model-type bias. Information-based machine learning enables data quality measurements, a priori task complexity estimations, and reproducible design of data science experiments. The benefits include significant size reduction, increased explainability, and enhanced resilience of models, all contributing to advancing the discipline\\'s robustness and credibility. While bridging the gap between machine learning and disciplines such as physics, information theory, and computer engineering, this textbook maintains an accessible and comprehensive style, making complex topics digestible fora broad readership. Information-Driven Machine Learning explores the synergistic harmony among these disciplines to enhance our understanding of data science modeling. Instead of solely focusing on the \"how,\" this text provides answers to the \"why\" questions that permeate the field, shedding light on the underlying principles of machine learning processes and their practical implications. By advocating for systematic methodologies grounded in fundamental principles, this book challenges industry practices that have often evolved from ideologic or profit-driven motivations. It addresses a range of topics, including deep learning, data drift, and MLOps, using fundamental principles such as entropy, capacity, and high dimensionality. Ideal for both academia and industry professionals, this textbook serves as a valuable tool for those seeking to deepen their understanding of data science as an engineering discipline. Its thought-provoking content stimulates intellectual curiosity and caters to readers who desire more than just code or ready-made formulas. The text invites readers to explore beyond conventional viewpoints, offering an alternative perspective that promotes a big-picture view for integrating theory with practice. Suitable for upper undergraduate or graduate-level courses, this book can also benefit practicing engineers and scientists in various disciplines by enhancing their understanding of modeling and improving data measurement effectively. ¬© The Editor(s)(if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

Solar energy figures as a natural option, despite its intermittence. Brazil has a green energy matrix with significant expansion of solar form in recent years. To preserve the Amazon basin, the use of solar energy can help communities and cities improve their living standards without new hydroelectric units or even to burn biomass, avoiding harsh environmental consequences. The novelty of this work is using data science with machine-learning tools to predict the solar incidence (W.h/m ) in four cities in Amazonas state (north-west Brazil), using data from NASA satellites within the period of 2013-22. Decision-tree-based models and vector autoregressive (time-series) models were used with three time aggregations: day, week and month. The predictor model can aid in the economic assessment of solar energy in the Amazon basin and the use of satellite data was encouraged by the lack of data from ground stations. The mean absolute error was selected as the output indicator, with the lowest values obtained close to 0.20, from the adaptive boosting and light gradient boosting algorithms, in the same order of magnitude of similar references. ¬© The Author(s) 2023.',\n",

In this study, we ascertained the impact of data science and AI education on learners‚Äô motivation and career development by analyzing a lecture-style course offered as part of mathematical and data science education at Tokyo City University, Japan. The course analyzed was Data Science Literacy 1 (DS1). The analysis period spanned three academic years, from 2020 to 2022. The analyzed items were three motivational factors derived from expectancy-value theory, namely intrinsic value, attainment utility value, and expectations for success. A fourth factor, career development, was also analyzed. We collected data pertaining to the four factors, that is, the three above mentioned motivational factors and career development, through questionnaires administered to DS1 learners. Regarding data analysis, learners were clas-sified according to the values (high vs. low) they reported for each of the four factors of interest at the beginning of the course. These were compared to the values reported at the end of the course. Results showed increases in all the motivation factors. The increasing trend was particularly pronounced among learners who initially reported low values. Although trends differed from year to year, the results suggest that data science and AI education can positively impact motivational factors and related career development. ¬© 2023, ICIC International.

       " 'Recent advances in data science are opening up new research fields and broadening the range of applications of stochastic dynamical systems. Considering the complexities in real-world systems (e.g., noisy data sets and high dimensionality) and challenges in mathematical foundation of machine learning, this review presents two perspectives in the interaction between stochastic dynamical systems and data science. On the one hand, deep learning helps to improve first principle-based methods for stochastic dynamical systems. AI for science, combining machine learning methods with available scientific understanding, is becoming a valuable approach to study stochastic dynamical systems with the help of observation data. On the other hand, a challenge is the theoretical explanations for deep learning. It is crucial to build explainable deep learning structures with the help of stochastic dynamical systems theory in order to demonstrate how and why deep learning works. In this review, we seek better understanding of the mathematical foundation of the state-of-the-art techniques in data science, with the help of stochastic dynamical systems, and we further apply machine learning tools for studying stochastic dynamical systems. This is achieved through stochastic analysis, algorithm development, and computational implementation. Topics involved with this review include Stochastic Analysis, Dynamical Systems, Inverse Problems, Data Assimilation, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, Nonparametric Statistics, Uncertainty Quantification, Deep Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

       " \"Despite optimistic forecasts, industry innovations in data science have extraordinarily high rates of failure. It is essential to minimise the failure of data science projects, for both businesses and data professionals. Human systems are critical to the success of data science innovations. However, the human aspects of innovation management are often neglected or omitted in most guidelines and frameworks for data science. This provides limited guidance about the necessary human conditions for successful data science innovations. In this article we address this concern by developing a systematic framework for understanding human systems that support data science innovations. We first reviewed the elements of human system at different levels of analysis and how they contribute to innovation. Substantial research and theory indicate successful innovation requires supports at different levels of organisations, which combine to create the organisation's innovation capability. The review provided an initial framework for integrating human systems with data science innovations. Then, we drew on a series of interviews with key innovators engaged in developing current data science innovations. The interviews generated a more complete picture of human systems in practice. The findings support a range of practices to energise and facilitate innovation as an integral part of strategic planning and business processes. This study contributes to the advancement of innovation management theories and calls attention to guiding and engaging individuals through providing support and removing barriers to data science at different organisational levels. More practically, innovation managers could use this as a guide to optimise work systems and inform pathways to improve organisation data science efforts. ¬© 2023 The Authors\",\n",
       " 'Letters of Recommendation (LORs) are widely utilized for admission to both undergraduate and graduate programs, and are becoming even more important with the decreasing role that standardized tests play in the admissions process. However, LORs are highly subjective and thus can inject recommender bias into the process, leading to an inequitable evaluation of the candidates‚Äô competitiveness and competence. Our study utilizes natural language processing methods and manually determined ratings to investigate gender and cultural differences and biases in LORs written for STEM Master‚Äôs program applicants. We generate features to measure important characteristics of the LORs and then compare these characteristics across groups based on recommender gender, applicant gender, and applicant country of origin. One set of features, which measure the underlying sentiment, tone, and emotions associated with each LOR, is automatically generated using IBM Watson‚Äôs Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service. The second set of features is measured manually by our research team and quantifies the relevance, specificity, and positivity of each LOR. We identify and discuss features that exhibit statistically significant differences across gender and culture study groups.

       " 'Modern technology offers new treatment options for patients and novel avenues of research. However, there is limited available information in easily understandable language for the public explaining how technology relates to them and could influence their healthcare. The researchers, healthcare professionals and public members worked together collaboratively to address this problem by creating new materials for the public. Our paper explores that project through creative methods. Firstly, everyone involved was offered an opportunity to attend training sessions. Then, people took photos and described them to illustrate to others what is their experience of working together. Finally, we all met to use included photos as building blocks to present a shared experience in the project. Afterwards, the professional artist included it as one circular illustration with six interlinked layers. These layers present everyone‚Äôs experiences (from inside) (1) is about the opportunity to build confidence in a new topic, (2) relationships with others, (3) working remotely during the pandemic, (4) motivation that influenced people to become involved in this particular piece of work, (5) expectation that the project needs be inclusive and accessible, (6) ethical principles that researchers using new technology should follow. We showed that it is possible for researchers, healthcare professionals and members of the public to feel joint ownership of the project and that working together can be meaningful to everyone. ¬© 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature. Background: The growth of data science and artificial intelligence offers novel healthcare applications and research possibilities. Patients should be able to make informed choices about using healthcare. Therefore, they must be provided with lay information about new technology. A team consisting of academic researchers, health professionals, and public contributors collaboratively co-designed and co-developed the new resource offering that information. In this paper, we evaluate this novel approach to co-production. Methods: We used participatory evaluation to understand the co-production process. This consisted of creative approaches and reflexivity over three stages. Firstly, everyone had an opportunity to participate in three online training sessions. The first one focused on the aims of evaluation, the second on photovoice (that included practical training on using photos as metaphors), and the third on being reflective (recognising one‚Äôs biases and perspectives during analysis). During the second stage, using photovoice, everyone took photos that symbolised their experiences of being involved in the project. This included a session with a professional photographer. At the last stage, we met in person and, using data collected from photovoice, built the mandala as a representation of a joint experience of the project. This stage was supported by professional artists who summarised the mandala in the illustration. Results: The mandala is the artistic presentation of the findings from the evaluation. It is a shared journey between everyone involved. We divided it into six related layers. Starting from inside layers present the following experiences (1) public contributors had space to build confidence in a new topic, (2) relationships between individuals and within the project, (3) working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, (4) motivation that influenced people to become involved in this particular piece of work, (5) requirements that co-production needs to be inclusive and accessible to everyone, (6) expectations towards data science and artificial intelligence that researchers should follow to establish public support. Conclusions: The participatory evaluation suggests that co-production around data science and artificial intelligence can be a meaningful process that is co-owned by everyone involved. ¬© 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.',\n",
       " 'Background: We present FHIR-PYrate, a Python package to handle the full clinical data collection and extraction process. The software is to be plugged into a modern hospital domain, where electronic patient records are used to handle the entire patient‚Äôs history. Most research institutes follow the same procedures to build study cohorts, but mainly in a non-standardized and repetitive way. As a result, researchers spend time writing boilerplate code, which could be used for more challenging tasks. Methods: The package can improve and simplify existing processes in the clinical research environment. It collects all needed functionalities into a straightforward interface that can be used to query a FHIR server, download imaging studies and filter clinical documents. The full capacity of the search mechanism of the FHIR REST API is available to the user, leading to a uniform querying process for all resources, thus simplifying the customization of each use case. Additionally, valuable features like parallelization and filtering are included to make it more performant. Results: As an exemplary practical application, the package can be used to analyze the prognostic significance of routine CT imaging and clinical data in breast cancer with tumor metastases in the lungs. In this example, the initial patient cohort is first collected using ICD-10 codes. For these patients, the survival information is also gathered. Some additional clinical data is retrieved, and CT scans of the thorax are downloaded. Finally, the survival analysis can be computed using a deep learning model with the CT scans, the TNM staging and positivity of relevant markers as input. This process may vary depending on the FHIR server and available clinical data, and can be customized to cover even more use cases. Conclusions: FHIR-PYrate opens up the possibility to quickly and easily retrieve FHIR data, download image data, and search medical documents for keywords within a Python package. With the demonstrated functionality, FHIR-PYrate opens an easy way to assemble research collectives automatically. ¬© 2023, The Author(s).',\n",

       " 'Personalised approaches to cancer therapeutics primarily involve identification of patient sub-populations most likely to benefit from targeted drugs. Such a stratification has led to plethora of designs of clinical trials that are often too complex due to the need for incorporating biomarkers and tissue types. Many statistical methods have been developed to address these issues; however, by the time such methodology is available research in cancer has moved on to new challenges and therefore in order to avoid playing catch-up it is necessary to develop new analytic tools alongside. One of the challenges facing cancer therapy is to effectively and appropriately target multiple therapies for sensitive patient population based on a panel of biomarkers across multiple cancer types, and matched future trial designs. We present novel geometric methods (mathematical theory of hypersurfaces) to visualise complex cancer therapeutics data as multidimensional, as well as geometric representation of oncology trial design space in higher dimensions. The hypersurfaces are used to describe master protocols, with application to a specific example of a basket trial design for melanoma, and thus setup a framework for further incorporating multi-omics data as multidimensional therapeutics. ¬© 2023, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Coherent Raman scattering (CRS) microscopy is a chemical imaging modality that provides contrast based on intrinsic biomolecular vibrations. To date, endeavors on instrumentation have advanced CRS into a powerful analytical tool for studies of cell functions and in situ clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, the small cross-section of Raman scattering sets up a physical boundary for the design space of a CRS system, which trades off speed, signal fidelity and spectral bandwidth. The synergistic combination of instrumentation and computational approaches offers a way to break the trade-off. In this review, we first introduce coherent Raman scattering and recent instrumentation developments, then discuss current computational CRS imaging methods, including compressive micro-spectroscopy, computational volumetric imaging, as well as machine learning algorithms that improve system performance and decipher chemical information.

Big data analysis (BDA) is the preferred approach to unleash hidden knowledge. However, BDA consumes excessive resources and time. These limitations hamper the meaningful adoption of BDA, especially the time and situation critical edge use cases, and hinder the goals of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. Automating the BDA process at the edge is a cognitive approach to address the aforementioned concerns. Data science workflow is an indispensable challenge for successful automation. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature survey on data science workflow platforms as the first contribution. Moreover, we learned that the BDA workflow depends on diversified constraints and undergoes rigorous data-mining stages. These caused an increase in the solution space, dynamic constraints, complexity issues, and NP-hardness of BDA workflow. Graphplan is a heuristic AI-planning technique that can address concerns associated with BDA workflow. Therefore, as the second contribution, we adopted the graphplan to generate a workflow for edge-based BDA automation.

To date, publicly available laparoscopic image datasets are mostly limited to general classifications of data, semantic segmentations of surgical instruments and low-volume weak annotations of specific abdominal organs. The Dresden Surgical Anatomy Dataset provides semantic segmentations of eight abdominal organs (colon, liver, pancreas, small intestine, spleen, stomach, ureter, vesicular glands), the abdominal wall and two vessel structures (inferior mesenteric artery, intestinal veins) in laparoscopic view. In total, this dataset comprises 13195 laparoscopic images. For each anatomical structure, we provide over a thousand images with pixel-wise segmentations. Annotations comprise semantic segmentations of single organs and one multi-organ-segmentation dataset including segments for all eleven anatomical structures. Moreover, we provide weak annotations of organ presence for every single image. This dataset markedly expands the horizon for surgical data science applications of computer vision in laparoscopic surgery and could thereby contribute to a reduction of risks and faster translation of Artificial Intelligence into surgical practice. ¬© 2023, The Author(s).',\n",
       " 'Biomedical data science education faces the challenge of preparing students for conducting rigorous research with increasingly complex and large datasets. At the same time, philosophers of science face the challenge of making their expertise accessible for scientists in such a way that it can improve everyday research practice. Here, we investigate the possibility of approaching these challenges together. In current and proposed approaches to biomedical data science education, we identify a dominant focus on only one aspect of conducting scientific research: understanding and using data, research methods, and statistical methods. We argue that this approach cannot solve biomedical data science‚Äôs challenge and we propose to shift the focus to four other aspects of conducting research: making and justifying decisions in research design and implementation, explaining their epistemic and non-epistemic effects, balancing varying responsibilities, and reporting scientific research. Attending to these aspects requires learning on different dimensions than solely learning to apply techniques (first dimension). It also requires learning to make choices (second dimension) and to understand the rationale behind choices (third dimension). This could be fostered by integrating philosophical training in biomedical data science education. Furthermore, philosophical training fosters a fourth dimension of learning, namely, understanding the nature of science. In this article, we explain how we identified the five aspects of conducting research and the four dimensions of learning, and why attending to the fourth dimension is essential. We discuss educational approaches to attend to all aspects and dimensions, and present initial design principles to implement these approaches. ¬© 2022, The Author(s).',\n",

       " 'Credit risk is the critical problem faced by banking and financial sectors when the borrower fails to complete their commitments to pay back. The factors that could increase credit risk are non-performing assets and frauds which are improved by continuous monitoring of payments and other assessment patterns. In past years, few statistical and manual auditing methods were investigated which were not much suitable for tremendous amount of data. Thus, the growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with efficient access to big data is focused. However, the effective Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are introduced to improve the performance and issues in banking and finance sectors by concentrating the business process and customer interaction. In this review, it mainly focusses on the different learning methods-based research articles available in recent years. This review also considers 93 recent research articles that were available in the last 5 years related to the topic of credit risk with different learning methods to tackle traditional challenges. Thus, these advances can make the banking process as smart and fast while preserving themselves from credit defaulters. ¬© 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.',\n",

       " 'This paper presents an adaptive data delivery method for data science pipelines. While this method is feasible for processes communicating over any network, in this work we focus on edge-fog-cloud infrastructures. In a diagnostic phase, a model based on the Bernoulli principle is used to create a representation of bottlenecks in a pipeline. In a supervision phase, a watchman/sentinel cooperative system monitors the throughput of the pipeline stages to create a bottleneck-stage scheme. In a rectification phase, this system produces replicas of bottlenecks stages, mitigating the workload congestion using implicit parallelism and load balancing algorithms. This method is automatically and transparently invoked to produce a steady continuum dataflow. To test our proposal, we conducted a case study about the processing of medical and satellite data. The evaluation revealed that this method creates continuum dataflows, without neither characterising workloads nor knowing infrastructure details, which yields a competitive performance with state-of-the-art solutions. ¬© 2023 ACM.',\n",
       " \"Data Science (DS) is emerging in major software development projects and often needs to follow software development practices. Therefore, DS processes will likely continue to attract Software Engineering (SE) practices and vice-versa. This case study aims to map and describe a software development process for Machine Learning(ML)-enabled applications and associated practices used in a real DS project at the Recod.ai laboratory in collaboration with an industrial partner. The focus was to analyze the process and identify the strengths and primary challenges, considering their expertise in robust ML practices and how they can contribute to general software quality. To achieve this, we conducted semi-structured interviews and analyzed them using procedures from the Straussian Grounded Theory. The results showed that the DS development process is iterative, with feedback between activities, which differs from the processes in the literature. Additionally, this process presents a greater involvement of domain experts. Besides, the team prioritizes software quality characteristics (attributes) in these DS projects to ensure some aspects of the final product's quality, i.e., functional correctness and robustness. To achieve those, they use regular accuracy metrics and include explainability and data leakage as quality metrics during training. Finally, the software engineer's role and its responsibilities differ from those of a traditional industry software engineer, as s/he is involved in most of the process steps. These characteristics can contribute to high-quality models achieving the partner needs and, consequently, relevant contributions to the intersection between SE and DS. ¬© 2023 ACM.\",\n",
       " 'There have been consistent calls for more research on managing teams and embedding processes in data science innovations. Widely used frameworks (e.g., the cross-industry standard process for data mining) provide a standardized approach to data science but are limited in features such as role clarity, skills, and cross-team collaboration that are essential for developing organizational capabilities in data science. In this study, we introduce a data workflow method (DWM) as a new approach to break organizational silos and create a multi-disciplinary team to develop, implement and embed data science. Different from current data science process workflows, the DWM is managed at the system level that shapes business operating model for continuous improvement, rather than as a function of a particular project, one single business unit, or isolated individuals. To further operationalize the DWM approach, we investigated an embedded data workflow at a mining operation that has been using geological data in a machine-learning model to stabilize daily mill production for the last 2years. Based on the findings in this study, we propose that the DWM approach derives its capability from three aspects: (a) a systemic data workflow; (b) multi-disciplinary networks of collaboration and responsibility; and (c) clearly identified data roles and the associated skills and expertise. This study suggests a whole-of-organization approach and pathway to develop data science capability. ¬© The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.',\n",
       " 'Development of non-aqueous redox flow batteries as a viable energy storage solution relies upon the identification of soluble charge carriers capable of storing large amounts of energy over extended time periods. A combination of metrics including number of electrons stored per molecule, redox potential, stability, and solubility of the charge carrier impact performance. In this context, we recently reported a 2,2‚Ä≤-bipyrimidine charge carrier that stores two electrons per molecule with reduction near ‚àí2.0 V vs. Fc/Fc+and high stability. However, these first-generation derivatives showed a modest solubility of 0.17 M (0.34 M e‚àí). Seeking to improve solubility without sacrificing stability, we harnessed the synthetic modularity of this scaffold to design a library of sixteen candidates. Using computed molecular descriptors and a single node decision tree, we found that minimization of the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) can be used to predict derivatives with enhanced solubility. This parameter was used in combination with a heatmap describing stability to de-risk a virtual screen that ultimately identified a 2,2‚Ä≤-bipyrimidine with significantly increased solubility and good stability metrics in the reduced states. This molecule was paired with a cyclopropenium catholyte in a prototype all-organic redox flow battery, achieving a cell potential up to 3 V. ¬© 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.',\n",

       " 'Early de-risking of drug targets and chemistry is essential to provide drug projects with the best chance of success. Target safety assessments (TSAs) use target biology, gene and protein expression data, genetic information from humans and animals, and competitor compound intelligence to understand the potential safety risks associated with modulating a drug target. However, there is a vast amount of information, updated daily that must be considered for each TSA. We have developed a data science‚Äìbased approach that allows acquisition of relevant evidence for an optimal TSA. This is built on expert-led conventional and artificial intelligence‚Äìbased mining of literature and other bioinformatics databases. Potential safety risks are identified according to an evidence framework, adjusted to the degree of target novelty. Expert knowledge is necessary to interpret the evidence and to take account of the nuances of drug safety, the modality, and the intended patient population for each TSA within each project. Overall, TSAs take full advantage of the most recent developments in data science and can be used within drug projects to identify and mitigate risks, helping with informed decision-making and resource management. These approaches should be used in the earliest stages of a drug project to guide decisions such as target selection, discovery chemistry options, in vitro assay choice, and end points for investigative in vivo studies. ¬© 2023 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.',\n",
       " 'The application of data science (DS) techniques has become increasingly essential in various fields, including epidemiology and climatology in agricultural production systems. In this sector, traditionally large amounts of data are acquired, but not well-managed and -analyzed as a basis for evidence-based decision-making processes. Here, we present a comprehensive step-by-step guide that explores the use of DS in managing epidemiological and climatological data within rice production systems under tropical conditions. Our work focuses on using the multi-temporal dataset associated with the monitoring of diseases and climate variables in rice in Colombia during eight years (2012‚Äì2019). The study comprises four main phases: (I) data cleaning and organization to ensure the integrity and consistency of the dataset; (II) data management involving web-scraping techniques to acquire climate information from free databases, like WordClim and Chelsa, validation against in situ weather stations, and bias removal to enrich the dataset; (III) data visualization techniques to effectively represent the gathered information, and (IV) a basic analysis related to the clustering and climatic characterization of rice-producing areas in Colombia. In our work, a process of evaluation and the validation of climate data are conducted based on errors (r, R2,MAE, RSME) and bias evaluation metrics. In addition, in phase II, climate clustering was conducted based on a PCA and K-means algorithm. Understanding the association of climatic and epidemiological data is pivotal in predicting and mitigating disease outbreaks in rice production areas. Our research underscores the significance of DS in managing epidemiological and climatological data for rice production systems. By applying a protocol responsible for DS tools, our study provides a solid foundation for further research into disease dynamics and climate interactions in rice-producing regions and other crops, ultimately contributing to more informed decision-making processes in agriculture. ¬© 2023 by the authors.',\n",

       " '(1) Background: Surgical phases form the basic building blocks for surgical skill assessment, feedback, and teaching. The phase duration itself and its correlation with clinical parameters at diagnosis have not yet been investigated. Novel commercial platforms provide phase indications but have not been assessed for accuracy yet. (2) Methods: We assessed 100 robot-assisted partial nephrectomy videos for phase durations based on previously defined proficiency metrics. We developed an annotation framework and subsequently compared our annotations to an existing commercial solution (Touch Surgery, Medtronic‚Ñ¢). We subsequently explored clinical correlations between phase durations and parameters derived from diagnosis and treatment. (3) Results: An objective and uniform phase assessment requires precise definitions derived from an iterative revision process. A comparison to a commercial solution shows large differences in definitions across phases. BMI and the duration of renal tumor identification are positively correlated, as are tumor complexity and both tumor excision and renorrhaphy duration. (4) Conclusions: The surgical phase duration can be correlated with certain clinical outcomes. Further research should investigate whether the retrieved correlations are also clinically meaningful. This requires an increase in dataset sizes and facilitation through intelligent computer vision algorithms. Commercial platforms can facilitate this dataset expansion and help unlock the full potential, provided that the phase annotation details are disclosed. ¬© 2023 by the authors.',\n",

When firms are designing such competitions, a key question is ‚ÄúWhat should be a better contest design to motivate contestants to exert more effort?‚Äù We model two commonly observed contest structures (one stage and two stage) and two widely adopted prize structures (high spread and low spread). We employ economic experiments to examine how contest design affects contestants‚Äô effort level. The results reject the base model with rationality assumption. We find that contestants exert significantly more effort in both the first stage and the second stage of the two-stage contest. Moreover, it is better to assign most prizes to the winner in the two-stage contest while it does not matter in one stage. To explain the empirical regularities, we develop a behavioral economics model that captures contestants‚Äô psychological aversion to falling behind and continuous exertion of effort. Our findings demonstrate that it is important for contest organizers to account for the nonpecuniary factors that can influence contestants‚Äô behavior in designing a competition. ¬© 2023 Production and Operations Management Society.',\n",

This limits the advancement of our principled understanding of development. This problem cannot be resolved by improving the way deductive (confirmatory) research is conducted (e.g., through preregistration and replication), because theory formation requires inductive (exploratory) research. This paper argues that machine learning can help advance theory formation in (developmental) psychology, because it enables rigorous exploration of patterns in data. The paper discusses specific advantages of machine learning, explains core methodological concepts, introduces relevant methods, and describes how data-driven insights are consolidated into theory. Machine learning automates exploration, and incorporates checks and balances to ensure generalizable results. It can assist in phenomenon detection and offers a more holistic understanding of the phenomena associated with an outcome or process of interest. ¬© 2022 The Author.

       " 'Nowadays, railway track monitoring strategies are based on the use of railway inspection vehicles and wayside dynamic monitoring systems. The latter sometimes requires traffic disruption, as well as higher time and cost-consumption activities, and the use of dedicated inspection vehicles is less economical and efficient as the use of in-service vehicles. Furthermore, the use of non-automated algorithms faces challenges when it comes to early damage detection in railway infrastructure, considering operational, environmental, and big data aspects, and may lead to false alarms. To overcome these challenges, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for early detection of track defects using accelerations, measured by dynamic monitoring systems in in-service railway vehicles is attracting the attention of railway managers. In this paper, an AI-based methodology based on axle box acceleration signals is applied for the early detection of distributed damage to track in terms of the longitudinal level and lateral alignment. The methodology relies on feature extraction using an autoregressive model, data normalization using principal component analysis, data fusion and feature discrimination using Mahalanobis distance and outlier analysis, considering eight onboard accelerometers. For the numerical simulations, 75 undamaged and 45 damaged track scenarios are considered. The alert limit state defined in the European Standard for assessing track geometry quality is also assumed as a threshold. It was found that the detection accuracy of the AI-based methodology for different sensor layouts and types of damage is greater than 94%, which is acceptable. ¬© 2023 by the authors.',\n",

The study tests five hypotheses, each scrutinized through a score-based Delphi analysis. The findings are mixed and shed new light on several dimensions of air conditioning project management. For instance, the study refutes the commonly held belief that the location of air conditioning projects significantly impacts worker safety. It also challenges the assumption that exceeding international safety standards like ISO leads to cost savings. On the other hand, the study validates the significance of global safety standards and the undeniable role of data sciences and smart technologies in enhancing human safety in the air conditioning industry. These findings not only challenge existing models, but also open avenues for further research. They indicate a complex interplay between safety, cost-effectiveness, and technological integration in air conditioning project management.

       " \"This paper introduces JAX-FEM, an open-source differentiable finite element method (FEM) library. Constructed on top of Google JAX, a rising machine learning library focusing on high-performance numerical computing, JAX-FEM is implemented with pure Python while scalable to efficiently solve problems with moderate to large sizes. For example, in a 3D tensile loading problem with 7.7 million degrees of freedom, JAX-FEM with GPU achieves around 10√ó acceleration compared to a commercial FEM code depending on platform. Beyond efficiently solving forward problems, JAX-FEM employs the automatic differentiation technique so that inverse problems are solved in a fully automatic manner without the need to manually derive sensitivities. Examples of 3D topology optimization of nonlinear materials are shown to achieve optimal compliance. Finally, JAX-FEM is an integrated platform for machine learning-aided computational mechanics.

       " 'Compound structural identification for non-targeted screening of organic molecules in complex mixtures is commonly carried out using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS and related techniques). Instrumental developments in recent years have increased the quality and quantity of data available; however, using current data analysis methods, structures can be assigned to only a small fraction of compounds present in typical mixtures. We present a new data analysis pipeline, ‚ÄúMSEI‚Äù, that harnesses data science methodologies to improve structural identification capabilities from tandem mass spectrometry data. In particular, feature vectors for fingerprint calculation are found directly from tandem mass spectra, strongly reducing computational costs, and fingerprint comparison uses an optimised methodology accounting for uncertainty to improve distinction between matching and non-matching compounds. MSEI builds on the identification of a small number of compounds through current state-of-the-art data analysis on UHPLC-HRMS/MS measurements and uses targeted training and tailored molecular fingerprints to focus identification to a particular molecular space of interest. Initial compound identifications are used as training data for a set of random forests which directly predict a custom 75-digit molecular fingerprint from a vectorised MS/MS spectrum. Kendrick mass defects (KMDs) for peaks as well as ‚Äúlost‚Äù\\xa0fragments removed during fragmentation were found to be useful information for fingerprint prediction. Fingerprints are then compared to potential matches from the PubChem structural database using Euclidean distance, with fingerprint digit weights determined using an SVM to maximise distance between matching and non-matching compounds. Potential matches are additionally filtered for hydrophobicity based on measured retention time, using a newly developed machine learning method for retention time prediction. MSEI was able to correctly assign > 50% of structures in a test dataset and showed > 10% better performance than current state-of-the-art methods, while using an order of magnitude less computational power and a fraction of the training data. ¬© 2023, The Author(s).',\n",

       " 'Unlike traditional offshore oil and gas projects which generally involve a limited number of structures and are confined to a relatively small seabed footprint, renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms can comprise many tens or even hundreds of structures dispersed across an extensive area. Driven by the need for offshore wind to reduce costs while also minimising project risk, there is currently a strong focus within the offshore industry on identifying new ways to extract the full benefit from all available site investigation data and carry this benefit through to engineering design. This paper provides a demonstration of two such approaches that utilise geo-data from offshore Western Australia, potentially representative of conditions of future offshore wind farms; the first is an integrated approach combining geophysical and geotechnical data through a seismic inversion process, while the second encompasses statistical analysis of geotechnical cone penetrometer and soil strength test data combined with a Bayesian compressive sampling-based spatial interpolation method. The demonstrations yielded useful findings about the methodologies and associated input requirements. It is envisaged this work will lead to the development of an efficient integrated framework for interpreting geo-data that will inform future offshore site investigation and geotechnical design practice. ¬© 2023 The Authors',\n",

PGRM phenotypes are standardized as phecodes, ensuring interoperability between biobanks. We applied the PGRM to five ancestry-specific cohorts from four independent biobanks and found evidence of robust replications across a wide array of phenotypes.

Over three academic terms, the author mandated these tools across courses in R, Python, C++, SQL, and more. The onboarding relied on simplified Emacs tutorials and starter configurations. Students gained proficiency after undertaking initial practice. Live coding sessions demonstrated the flexible instruction enabled by literate notebooks. Assignments and projects required documentation alongside functional code. Student feedback showed enthusiasm for learning a versatile IDE, despite some frustration with the learning curve. Skilled students highlighted efficiency gains in a unified environment. However, the uneven adoption of documentation practices pointed to a need for better incorporation into grading. Additionally, some students found Emacs unintuitive, desiring more accessible options. This highlights a need to match tools to skill levels, potentially starting novices with graphical IDEs before introducing Emacs. The key takeaways are as follows: literate programming aids comprehension but requires rigorous onboarding and reinforcement, and Emacs excels for advanced workflows but has a steep initial curve. With proper support, these tools show promise for data science education. ¬© 2023 by the author.',\n",
       " 'One of the most important elements of the reliability structure of a motor vessel is its power subsystem, with the most crucial component being the engine. An engine failure excludes the ship from operation or significantly limits its operation. Therefore, accurate fault diagnosis should be a crucial issue for modern maintenance strategies. In mechanical engineering, the vibration and acoustic signals recorded during the operation of the device are the most meaningful data used to identify the reliability state. In this paper, a novel system-oriented method of reliability state identification is proposed. The method consists of the analysis of the vibration and noise signals collected on each of the engine cylinders using supervised machine learning. The main novelty of this method is data augmentation application and SVM classifier implementation. Due to these aspects, the method becomes robust in the case of poor-quality data or a limited and incomplete learning dataset. The quality of the proposed identification method was evaluated by addressing a new industrial issue (Sulzer 6AL20/24 marine engine reliability state identification). During the tests, the efficiency of the method was analyzed in the case of a complete learning data set (all types of inability states were presented in the learning data set) and an incomplete learning data set (in the testing data set, there were new types of inability states). As a result, in both cases, a very high (100%) identification accuracy of the reliability state and the type of inability state was obtained. This is a significant increase in accuracy (4.6% for the complete and 22% for the incomplete learning data set) in comparison to the efficiency of the same method without the use of machine learning and data science. ¬© 2023 by the authors.',\n",
       " 'The concept of a digital twin (DT) has gained significant attention in academia and industry because of its perceived potential to address critical global challenges, such as climate change, healthcare, and economic crises. Originally introduced in manufacturing, many attempts have been made to present proper definitions of this concept. Unfortunately, there remains a great deal of confusion surrounding the underlying concept, with many scientists still uncertain about the distinction between a simulation, a mathematical model and a DT. The aim of this paper is to propose a formal definition of a digital twin. To achieve this goal, we utilize a data science framework that facilitates a functional representation of a DT and other components that can be combined together to form a larger entity we refer to as a digital twin system (DTS). In our framework, a DT is an open dynamical system with an updating mechanism, also referred to as complex adaptive system (CAS). Its primary function is to generate data via simulations, ideally, indistinguishable from its physical counterpart. On the other hand, a DTS provides techniques for analyzing data and decision-making based on the generated data. Interestingly, we find that a DTS shares similarities to the principles of general systems theory. This multi-faceted view of a DTS explains its versatility in adapting to a wide range of problems in various application domains such as engineering, manufacturing, urban planning, and personalized medicine. ¬© 2023 by the author.',\n",

First, RtS implies the duty to end data monetization in so far as it entails practices harmful to human rights, including unlawful interference with privacy. Second, while data monetization exists, RtS entails the duty to distribute monetary benefits through an RtS-based universal basic income (UBI). Third, RtS entails the duty to facilitate ordinary people's participation in DS and prioritize non-profit pro-social uses of DS as in citizen or community DS.

The majority of virus-infected persons have mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover on their own. However, some people get serious ailments and need medical attention.

Nowadays, medical science is based on data science technology to achieve new milestones in genetics, genomics, patient-customer assistance, clinical imaging, drug discovery, and predictive medicine. It has gained due to Covid-19. This paper proposes a novel method: Extended and Compressed Convolution Hybrid Leader-based Optimization (ECCHLO) to differentiate between Covid-19 infected persons and healthy individuals. This outline involves four steps. The initial step is preprocessing the X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan images gathered from the datasets. In the second step, feature extraction is performed. Next, feature fusion is performed to eliminate redundant and unnecessary data. Finally, the Extended Hybrid Leader-Based Optimization (EHLBO) algorithm is utilized to tune the parameters of compressed convolutional neural networks. The ECCHLO model is examined and tested on four datasets, namely SARS-COV-2, Covid-19 radiography database, Covid-CT, and Covid-19 Image datasets. The accuracy of these four datasets is 99.6%, 99.5%, 99.3%, and 100%, respectively, which are higher than the other techniques.

       " \"Plasticity is increasingly recognized as a critical concept in psychiatry and mental health because it allows the reorganization of neural circuits and behavior during the transition from psychopathology to wellbeing. Differences in individual plasticity may explain why therapies, such as psychotherapeutic and environmental interventions, are highly effective in some but not in all patients. Here I propose a mathematical formula to assess plasticity ‚Äì i.e., the susceptibility to change ‚Äì to identify, at baseline, which individuals or populations are more likely to modify their behavioral outcome according to therapies or contextual factors. The formula is grounded in the network theory of plasticity so that, when representing a system (e.g., a patient's psychopathology) as a weighed network where the nodes are the system features (e.g., symptoms) and the edges are the connections (i.e., correlations) among them, the network connectivity strength is an inverse measure of the plasticity of the system: the weaker the connectivity, the higher the plasticity and the greater the susceptibility to change. The formula is predicted to be generalizable, measuring plasticity at multiple scales, from the single cell to the whole brain, and can be applied to a wide range of research fields, including neuroscience, psychiatry, ecology, sociology, physics, market and finance. ¬© 2023 Elsevier Ltd\",\n",
       " 'The sustainable phaseout of high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant mixtures requires novel solvents, such as ionic liquids (ILs), for new HFC reuse and recycle technologies. Accurate, predictive, and interpretable thermodynamic models for HFC/IL mixtures are essential for multiscale design schemes aiding this phaseout. Still, there is limited guidance regarding the best thermodynamic model for an HFC/IL system. We propose a rigorous thermodynamic model selection and analysis workflow for HFC/IL mixtures which harnesses data science tools ‚Äì visualization, nonlinear regression, Akaike information criteria, Fischer information matrix (FIM)-based identifiability and uncertainty analyses, and model-based design of experiments methods ‚Äì to evaluate the accuracy, predictive capability, and interpretability of a thermodynamic model. The open-source IDAES‚Ñ¢ platform facilitates training and comparison of sixteen candidate HFC/IL thermodynamic models, including two cubic equations of state, Peng‚ÄìRobinson and Soave‚ÄìRedlich‚ÄìKwong, and eight variations on temperature dependence within a classical van der Waals mixing rule. We apply this analysis to models for three HFC/IL systems: HFC-32/[emim][TF2N], HFC-125/[emim][TF2N], and HFC-32/[bmim][PF6]. For these mixtures, we observe that models with a temperature dependent mixing rule are consistently ranked higher by Akaike information criteria for model selection. However, these models may still have high parameter uncertainty and correlation, indicating that data at multiple temperatures should be obtained. This result differs from the current practice of generating single isotherm dataset for most new HFC/IL mixtures. Additionally, we find that the most valuable experiments are taken at the bounds of composition, temperature (e.g., 273 and 348 K), and pressure (e.g., 1 MPa) measurements. This analysis guides data generation efforts, showing that optimally selected measurements across multiple temperatures are adequate for regressing thermodynamic models for multiscale process design. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

Although exceptionally effective, this approach provides limited insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the transformations and necessitates multiple protein engineering campaigns for new reactants. To address this limitation, we disclose a strategy to explore the biocatalytic reaction space and garner insight into the molecular mechanisms driving enzymatic transformations. Specifically, we explored the selectivity of an ‚Äúene‚Äù-reductase, GluER-T36A, to create a data-driven toolset that explores reaction space and rationalizes the observed and predicted selectivities of substrate/mutant combinations. The resultant statistical models related structural features of the enzyme and substrate to selectivity and were used to effectively predict selectivity in reactions with out-of-sample substrates and mutants. Our approach provided a deeper understanding of enantioinduction by GluER-T36A and holds the potential to enhance the virtual screening of enzyme mutants. ¬© 2023 American Chemical Society.',\n",
       " \"In the era of distributed computing, Cloud Computing (CC) has been considered an emerging technology that delivers on-demand services using the worldwide online medium. One of this technology's main challenges is scheduling tasks and allocating resources to achieve the best performance with minimal optimized execution time, and less resource time and usage. Thus, the importance of task priority has been recognized by many researchers since tasks submitted to the cloud can have various sizes, resource utilization, and execution times. Therefore, existing task scheduling algorithms prioritize tasks, where the task with the highest priority is allocated to the available resource. This paper investigated the task priority problem in cloud-based Task Scheduling (TS) algorithms via three different directions centered around the following contributions; first, a fruitful discussion and comparison of some selected cloud priority-based TS algorithms regarding their scheduling method and parameters, algorithm performance, and limitations reflecting how the priority issue is handled in the cloud environment. In the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence age, the interaction and intervention between the Big Data sector and CC are gradually advancing due to mutual development. Cloud environments have become a prominent platform for big data applications, forcing the integration between Data Science and CC techniques to evolve. On this basis, secondly, the paper addresses the directions of potential future research of cloud priority-based TS schemes in Data Science. Finally, as a result, a conceptual framework incorporating a task content-type component is proposed to support the processing and scheduling of data-related tasks submitted to the cloud. ¬© 2023 Little Lion Scientific.\",\n",

Like many neurological disorder phenotypes, the diagnostic features are observable, can be tracked over time, and can be managed or even eliminated through proper therapy and treatments. However, there are major bottlenecks in the diagnostic, therapeutic, and longitudinal tracking pipelines for autism and related neurodevelopmental delays, creating an opportunity for novel data science solutions to augment and transform existing workflows and provide increased access to services for affected families. Several efforts previously conducted by a multitude of research labs have spawned great progress toward improved digital diagnostics and digital therapies for children with autism. We review the literature on digital health methods for autism behavior quantification and beneficial therapies using data science. We describe both case-control studies and classification systems for digital phenotyping. We then discuss digital diagnostics and therapeutics that integrate machine learning models of autism-related behaviors, including the factors that must be addressed for translational use.

       " 'Health data science systems are becoming key for supporting healthcare decision-making processes. However, these systems should achieve continuous data processing and adapt their behavior to changes arising in real scenarios. Nevertheless, building this type of self-adaptable systems is not trivial, as it requires integrating data analytics and artificial intelligence with cloud computing tools and security and fault tolerance applications. This produces delays in the processing of data, affecting the information delivery in decision-making processes. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a method to build self-adaptable data science services by using dynamic patterns. This method includes two models: a construction model and a coupling model. The construction model is based on dynamic parallel patterns to create, at design time, in-memory processing structures including as many applications as needed to meet the non-functional requirements (NFRs), such as security and fault tolerance, established by healthcare organizations without affecting the efficiency of a data science system. In turn, the coupling model converts the in-memory processing structures into software blocks that are coupled with the I/O interfaces of data science systems to support the automatic and transparent continuous management of data for facing changes in the incoming workload during execution time. A prototype was implemented to create self-adaptable health data science systems including in-memory processing structures for managing spirometry studies, tomography images, and electrocardiograms. The performance evaluation showed that the dynamic patterns significantly reduced the response time required to prepare contents with NFR characteristics in comparison with solutions from the state-of-the-art such as Nextflow and Makeflow. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

However, the bridge from research to practice can be fraught with sociopolitical frictions that impede, or altogether block, such translations-especially when they are contentious or otherwise difficult to achieve. Focusing on one entrenched educational equity issue in US public schools-racial and ethnic segregation-we conduct randomized email outreach experiments and surveys to explore how local school districts respond to algorithmically-generated school catchment areas (\"attendance boundaries\") designed to foster more diverse and integrated schools. Cold email outreach to approximately 4,320 elected school board members across over 800 school districts informing them of potential boundary changes reveals a large average open rate of nearly 40%, but a relatively small click-through rate of 2.5% to an interactive dashboard depicting such changes. Board members, however, appear responsive to different messaging techniques - -particularly those that dovetail issues of racial and ethnic diversity with other top-of-mind issues (like school capacity planning). On the other hand, media coverage of the research drives more dashboard engagement, especially in more segregated districts. A small but rich set of survey responses from school board and community members across several districts identify data and operational bottlenecks to implementing boundary changes to foster more diverse schools, but also share affirmative comments on the potential viability of such changes. Together, our findings may support educational data scientists in more effectively disseminating research that aims to bridge educational inequalities through systems-level change. ¬© 2023 ACM.',\n",

       " 'Purpose: Underlying much recent development in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) is a dependence on the labour of precarious crowdworkers via platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. These platforms have been widely critiqued for their exploitative labour relations, and over recent years, there have been various efforts by academic researchers to develop interventions aimed at improving labour conditions. The aim of this paper is to explore US-based crowdworkers‚Äô views on two proposed interventions: a browser plugin that detects automated quality control ‚ÄúGold Question‚Äù (GQ) checks and a proposal for a crowdworker co-operative. Design/methodology/approach: The authors interviewed 20 US-based crowdworkers and undertook a thematic analysis of collected data. Findings: The findings indicate that US-based crowdworkers tend to have negative and mixed feelings about the GQ detector, but were more enthusiastic about the crowdworker co-operative. Originality/value: Drawing on theories of precarious labour, this study suggests an explanation for the findings based on US-based workers‚Äô objective and subjective experiences of precarity. The authors argue that for US-based crowdworkers ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù interventions such as a crowdworker co-operative have more potential to improve labour conditions. ¬© 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.',\n",

       " \"Data's increasing role in society and high profile reproduction of inequalities is in tension with traditional methods of using social data for social justice. Alongside this, ‚Äòintersectionality‚Äô has increased in prominence as a critical social theory and praxis to address inequalities. Yet, there is not a comprehensive review of how intersectionality is operationalized in research data practice. In this study, we examined how intersectionality researchers across a range of disciplines conduct intersectional analysis as a means of unpacking how intersectional praxis may advance an intersectional data science agenda. To explore how intersectionality researchers collect and analyze data, we conducted a critical discourse analysis approach in a review of 172 articles that stated using an intersectional approach in some way. We contemplated whether and how Collins‚Äô three frames of relationality were evident in their approach. We found an over-reliance on the additive thinking frame in quantitative research, which poses limits on the potential for this research to address structural inequality. We suggest ways in which intersectional data science could adopt an articulation mindset to improve on this tendency. ¬© The Author(s) 2023.\",\n",

With increasing numbers of campaigns, numbers of sensors and campaign time, the volume and heterogeneity of the data, ranging from simple temperature time series to series of HD images or video call for new data science approaches to analyze the data. While some works have been published on the analysis of data from one campaign, we address the problem of analyzing time series data from two consecutive monitoring campaigns (starting late 2017 and late 2018) in the same habitat. While the data from campaigns in two separate years provide an interesting basis for marine biology research, it also presents new data science challenges, like the the marine image analysis in data form more than one campaign. In this paper, we analyze the polyp activity of two Paragorgia arborea cold water coral (CWC) colonies using FUO data collected from November 2017 to June 2018 and from December 2018 to April 2019. We successfully apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the segmentation and classification of the coral and the polyp activities. The result polyp activity data alone showed interesting temporal patterns with differences and similarities between the two time periods. A one month ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù period in spring with almost no activity was observed in both coral colonies, but with a shift of approximately one month. A time series prediction experiment allowed us to predict the polyp activity from the non-image sensor data using recurrent neural networks (RNN). The results pave a way to a new multi-sensor monitoring strategy for Paragorgia arborea behaviour. ¬© 2023 van Kevelaer et al.

The need for human-supported algorithms to capture patterns in big data is at the center of personalized healthcare and directly related to translational research. This paper argues that hypothesis-driven and data-driven research work together to inform the research process. At the core of these approaches are theoretical underpinnings that drive progress in the field. Here, we present several exemplars of research on the gut-brain axis that outline the innate values and challenges of these approaches. As nurses are trained to integrate multiple body systems to inform holistic human health promotion and disease prevention, nurses and nurse scientists serve an important role as mediators between this advancing technology and the patients.

Engaging students in Knowledge Building (KB) may be a promising way to respond to this challenge because it requires students to reflect on and direct their inquiry with the support of data. Informed by previous studies, this research explored how an analytics-supported reflective assessment (AsRA)-enhanced KB design influenced 6th graders' KB and data science practices in a science education setting. One intact class with 56 students participated in this study. The analysis of students' Knowledge Forum discourse showed the positive influences of the AsRA-enhanced KB design on students' development of KB and data science practices. Further analysis of different-performing groups revealed that the AsRA-enhanced KB design was accessible to all performing groups. These findings have important implications for teachers and researchers who aim to develop students' KB and data science practices, and general high-level collaborative inquiry skills. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Data use becomes increasingly important in the K-12 educational context. Little is known about how to scaffold students to develop data science practices. Knowledge Building (KB) and learning analytics-supported reflective assessment (AsRA) show premises in developing these practices.

While this is a relatively new area of study in the media landscape, the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence has increased substantially over the last few years. In particular, the adoption of data science models for personalization and recommendation has attracted the attention of several media publishers. Following this trend, this paper presents a research literature analysis on the role of Data Science (DS) in Digital Journalism (DJ). Specifically, the aim is to present a critical literature review, synthetizing the main application areas of DS in DJ, highlighting research gaps, challenges, and opportunities for future studies. Through a systematic literature review integrating bibliometric search, text mining, and qualitative discussion, the relevant literature was identified and extensively analyzed. The review reveals an increasing use of DS methods in DJ, with almost 47% of the research being published in the last three years. An hierarchical clustering highlighted six main research domains focused on text mining, event extraction, online comment analysis, recommendation systems, automated journalism, and exploratory data analysis along with some machine learning approaches. Future research directions comprise developing models to improve personalization and engagement features, exploring recommendation algorithms, testing new automated journalism solutions, and improving paywall mechanisms. ¬© 2023 The Author(s)',\n",

       " 'Data science has gained the attention of various industries, educators, parents, and students thinking about their future careers. Statistics departments have traditionally offered data science courses for a long time. The main objective of these courses is to examine the fundamental concepts and theories. However, teaching data science courses has also expanded to other disciplines due to the vast amount of data being collected by numerous modern applications. Also, someone needs to learn how to collect and process data, especially from industrial devices, because of the recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Hence, integrating data science into the curricula of different engineering branches becomes a matter of relating the statistics background to the specific discipline. There are several reasons for this transition. Firstly, as the increased computational power and massive availability of the data make the use of statistical theories possible in more engineering applications, there is a growing need for engineering students to build knowledge in data science concepts. Secondly, the wide availability of libraries and models allows for the implementation of diverse solutions to engineering problems.

       " \"In the field of data science, advancements in the field of machine learning have led to programs developing high-level reasoning, intricate data understanding, and groundbreaking predictive models. Machine Learning (ML) research aims at making a program 'learn,' that is, develop models and techniques with known information to be able to handle future problems. Traditionally, this is done by increasing the quantity and quality of input data and training the learner in more effective ways to interpret that information. This has a direct parallel to the collegiate classroom, as instructors aim to inspire mastery over a topic to their students through a variety of methods (homework problems, examinations, projects, etc.) and teach them the corresponding skillsets from feedback on these assignments. Machine Teaching (MT) research, on the other hand, aims at making the teacher more productive by using their own cognitive models to improve the quality of the data holistically. Again, this has a corresponding counterpart to current teaching pedagogies; the instructor decides on the details of an assignment from their own knowledge and experience with the end goal of having students retain the information and apply it to future problems.

Data science courses offered by programs such as mathematics, computer science, and data science in academic institutions normally lack the implementation in solving engineering problems. To fill this gap, we have developed a project-based technical elective course ‚ÄúMachine Learning for Mechanical Engineers‚Äù and offered it to undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Arkansas. While this course is received very well by the students and has led to fruitful presentations and publications, it has a low enrollment volume from undergraduate students due to its relatively high programming requirements. A more sophisticated strategy is required to equip mechanical engineering students with data science skills without disturbing the existing curriculum. Inspired by the success of computer-aided design education at the University of Arkansas and the Data Science InFusion into Undergraduate STEM Education (DIFUSE) program at Dartmouth College, we have developed course-specific machine learning modules to be integrated into mechanical engineering core courses rather than dedicated data science courses. This effort includes a nonparametric regression module for Computer Methods in Mechanical Engineering, a generative design module for Computer-Aided Design, and a genetic algorithms module for Thermal Systems Analysis and Design, among others.

Given the rapid adoption of data analytics in engineering and the societal importance of many of its applications, there is an urgent need to train the next generation of civil engineers in data science. Several studies have emphasized that the use of data science in the present civil engineering undergraduate curricula is mostly restricted to simple introductory subjects, usually with the use of Microsoft Excel. The curriculum does not encourage students to fully benefit from big data since data science is not extensively used. Additionally, there is a lack of clear guidance on how to strengthen the synergy between common civil engineering courses and data science.

The course aims at empowering students with the necessary tools to apply statistics in a civil engineering context, and perform data transformation, data wrangling, visualization, and modeling using R for data science. Students learn how to gather and analyze data as part of the engineering design process, apply systems thinking to an engineering or societal phenomenon, collaborate with peers to find solutions, and effectively present solutions to an audience.

       " 'Identifying the proxy data and techniques that could yield greater PM2.5estimation accuracy remains challenging due to the lack of general knowledge on the relative performance of covariates and modeling methods on the PM2.5modeling accuracy. To bridge a critical gap in the contemporary literature on how to improve satellite-based PM2.5estimation models, we have systematically reviewed global efforts at PM2.5estimation between 2000 and 2020 using big data analytics, focusing on a critical evaluation of PM2.5modeling accuracy improvements in response to varying methods and covariates, mainly from remote sensing and data science perspectives. Using an automated literature classification deep learning method, we identified 833 publications with fair inter-comparisons among relevant PM2.5estimation models. The inter-compared modeling accuracy metrics were then retrieved and aggregated with respect to each modeling factor to form a global research synthesis database. The synthesized results highlighted that greater PM2.5modeling accuracy (i.e., a mean R2improvement by 6.2%) can be attained by incorporating aerosol optical depth (AOD); this benefit could even be doubled by applying fine-mode AOD. Further enhancements could be achieved by conducting vertical and humidity corrections to AOD (10.41%), as well as including relevant meteorological and socioeconomic factors that are highly associated with PM2.5variations (12%, on average). By contrast, improving spatial resolution of satellite AOD products and temporal resolution of ground PM2.5measurements are unlikely to yield better PM2.5estimation accuracy (improvement of 1.2%). Although advanced machine learning algorithms with better generalization capacity is more cost-effective, the accuracy improvements vary substantially across studies, largely depending on data sources, study regions, and even seasons. The statistical findings underscore the critical importance of domain knowledge and advancements in remote sensing and data science for improving PM2.5modeling accuracy. Finally, with inferred knowledge from this quantitative evidence, we discuss the grand challenges and possible solutions for future research directions toward better PM2.5prediction, mapping, and exposure assessment. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.',\n",

The heterogeneity of the data and its overwhelming magnitude have made it impossible to perform manual analysis. As a consequence, new techniques have been developed and different strategies have been amalgamated, such as data science and data mining, in order to carry out more in-depth and exhaustive analyses in search of the extraction of the knowledge contained in data. This paper introduces a data science methodology that consists of successive stages, with the core of this proposal being the step of data preprocessing, with the aim of reducing the complexity of the analysis and enabling hidden knowledge in the data to be uncovered. The proposed methodology was tested on a set of data consisting of artificial light curves that try to mimic the behaviour of the strong gravitational lens phenomenon, as supplied by the Time Delay Challenge 1 (TDC1). Under the data science methodology, diverse statistical methods were implemented for data analysis, and cross-correlation and dispersion methods were applied for the time-delay estimation of strong lensing systems. With this methodology, we obtained time-delay estimations from the TDC1 data set and compared them with earlier results reported by the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses project (COSMOGRAIL). The empirical evidence leads us to conclude that, with the proposed methodology, we achieve a greater accuracy in estimating time delays compared with estimations made with raw data. ¬© 2023 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.',\n",

Although current computational training creates an excellent starting place, linear styles of scripting can risk becoming labor- and time-intensive and less reproducible by often requiring manual execution. Pipelines, however, can be easily automated or tracked by software to increase efficiency and reduce potential errors. Ecology and evolution would benefit from techniques that reduce these risks by managing analytical pipelines in a modular, readily parallelizable format with clear documentation of dependencies. Workflow management software (WMS) can aid in the reproducibility, intelligibility and computational efficiency of complex pipelines. To date, WMS adoption in ecology and evolutionary research has been slow. We discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing WMS and illustrate its use through a case study with the targets r package to further highlight WMS benefits through workflow automation, dependency tracking and improved clarity for reviewers. Although WMS requires familiarity with function-oriented programming and careful planning for more advanced applications and pipeline sharing, investment in training will enable access to the benefits of WMS and impart transferable computing skills that can facilitate ecological and evolutionary data science at large scales. ¬© 2023 The Authors.

       " 'ChatGPT, a conversational AI interface that utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, is taking the world by storm and is the buzzword across many sectors today. Given the likely impact of this model on data science, through this perspective article, we seek to provide an overview of the potential opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT in data science, provide readers with a snapshot of its advantages, and stimulate interest in its use for data science projects. The paper discusses how ChatGPT can assist data scientists in automating various aspects of their workflow, including data cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation. It also highlights how ChatGPT has the potential to provide new insights and improve decision-making processes by analyzing unstructured data. We then examine the advantages of ChatGPT‚Äôs architecture, including its ability to be fine-tuned for a wide range of language-related tasks and generate synthetic data. Limitations and issues are also addressed, particularly around concerns about bias and plagiarism when using ChatGPT. Overall, the paper concludes that the benefits outweigh the costs and ChatGPT has the potential to greatly enhance the productivity and accuracy of data science workflows and is likely to become an increasingly important tool for intelligence augmentation in the field of data science. ChatGPT can assist with a wide range of natural language processing tasks in data science, including language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. However, while ChatGPT can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch, and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, it may not perform well on certain tasks if it has not been specifically trained for them. Additionally, the output of ChatGPT may be difficult to interpret, which could pose challenges for decision-making in data science applications. ¬© 2023 by the authors.',\n",

Actually, in planning the packaging of a new product on the market, due to the many variables that can influence the result, it is necessary to conduct a high number of preliminary analyses. It is therefore desirable to develop an automated method that allows obtaining information and reduces the analysis time and cost. In this work, we propose the use of data science/machine learning methods to verify, but also to predict, the effectiveness of the packaging in the Food&Beverage sector. As proof of concept, after doing a public survey about some Food&Beverage packaging, we value the ability of a feedforward Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network, in predicting the results, i.e. if and how much the consumer likes the packaging. Trained MLP shows a very high correlations coefficient (> 0.98) and low mean square error (7.97) and error percentage (5.76%) values in determining the consumer response. ¬© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.',\n",
       " \"Data Science (DS) has emerged from the shadows of its parents‚Äîstatistics and computer science‚Äîinto an independent field since its origin nearly six decades ago. Its evolution and education have taken many sharp turns. We present an impressionistic study of the evolution of DS anchored to Kuhn's four stages of paradigm shifts. First, we construct the landscape of DS based on curriculum analysis of the 32 iSchools across the world offering graduate-level DS programs. Second, we paint the ‚Äúfield‚Äù as it emerges from the word frequency patterns, ranking, and clustering of course titles based on text mining. Third, we map the curriculum to the landscape of DS and project the same onto the Edison Data Science Framework (2017) and ACM Data Science Knowledge Areas (2021). Our study shows that the DS programs of iSchools align well with the field and correspond to the Knowledge Areas and skillsets. iSchool's DS curriculums exhibit a bias toward ‚Äúdata visualization‚Äù along with machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence; go light on statistics; slanted toward ontologies and health informatics; and surprisingly minimal thrust toward eScience/research data management, which we believe would add a distinctive iSchool flavor to the DS. ¬© 2022 Association for Information Science and Technology.\",\n",

Thus, the aim was to systematically map the different forms of information organization and representation applied to objects from collections belonging to institutions affiliated with the federal government's Special Department of Culture. This diagnosis is then used to discuss the requirements of devising strategies that favor a better data science information infrastructure to reuse information on Brazil's cultural heritage. Content analysis was used to identify analytical categories and obtain a broader understanding of the documentary sources of these institutions in order to extract, analyze, and interpret the data involved. A total of 215 hyperlinks that can be considered cultural collections of the institutions studied were identified, representing 2,537,921 cultural heritage items. The results show that the online publication of Brazil's digital cultural heritage is limited in terms of technology, copyright licensing, and established information organization practices.

       " 'As data science and instrumentation become key practices in common careers ranging from medicine to agriscience, chemistry as a core introductory course must introduce such topics to students early and at an accessible level. Advanced data acquisition and data science generally require expensive precision instrumentation and massive computation, often out-of-reach even for upper-level undergraduate laboratory courses. At the same time, a new generation of affordable do-it-yourself instruments presents an opportunity for incorporation of curricula focused on instrument design and computation into freshman-level courses. We present a new lab for integration into existing courses that starts with hands-on spectrometer building, moves to data collection, and finally introduces an advanced data science technique, singular value decomposition, at an appropriate level with minimal computing requirements. The hardware and software used are modular and inexpensive. The lab was tested in three community college general chemistry sections over two semesters. Previously, students taking these courses did not typically see advanced quantitative chemistry curricula before deciding whether to pursue a bachelor‚Äôs degree. This lab allowed students to practice data collection and organization skills, use prewritten Jupyter notebooks that perform advanced data analysis, and gain presentation skills. A multiwave assessment completed by students highlights both successes and difficulties associated with incorporating multiple advanced topics involving instrument design, data collection, and analysis techniques in a single lab. ¬© 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.',\n",

       " 'Modeling the failure times of processors and memories in computers is crucial for ensuring the reliability and robustness of data science workflows. By understanding the failure characteristics of the hardware components, data scientists can develop strategies to mitigate the impact of failures on their computations, and design systems that are more fault-tolerant and resilient. In particular, failure time modeling allows data scientists to predict the likelihood and frequency of hardware failures, which can help inform decisions about system design and resource allocation. In this paper, we aimed to model the failure times of processors and memories of computers; this was performed by formulating a new type of bivariate model using the copula function. The modified extended exponential distribution is the suggested lifetime of the experimental units. It was shown that the new bivariate model has many important properties, which are presented in this work. The inferential statistics for the distribution parameters were obtained under the assumption of a Type-II censored sampling scheme. Therefore, point and interval estimation were observed using the maximum likelihood and the Bayesian estimation methods. Additionally, bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated. Numerical analysis via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was performed. Finally, a real data example of processors and memories failure time was examined and the efficiency of the new bivariate distribution of fitting the data sample was observed by comparing it with other bivariate models. ¬© 2023 by the authors.',\n",

Accumulated PAP data provide valuable and objective information regarding patient treatment adherence and efficiency. However, the majority of studies that have analyzed longitudinal PAP remote monitoring have summarized data trajectories in static and simplistic metrics for PAP adherence and the residual apnea-hypopnea index by the use of mean or median values. The aims of this article are to suggest directions for improving data cleaning and processing and to address major concerns for the following data science applications: (1) conditions for residual apnea-hypopnea index reliability, (2) lack of standardization of indicators provided by different PAP models, (3) missing values, and (4) consideration of treatment interruptions. To allow fair comparison among studies and to avoid biases in computation, PAP data processing and management should be conducted rigorously with these points in mind. PAP remote monitoring data contain a wealth of information that currently is underused in the field of sleep research.

       " \"Based on the assumption that the success of an organization is largely determined by the knowledge and skills of its employees, human resource (HR) departments invest considerable resources in the employee recruitment process with the aim of selecting the best, most suitable employees. Due to the high cost of the recruitment process along with its high rate of uncertainty, HR recruiters utilize a variety of methods and instruments to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of this process. Thus far, however, neurological methods, in which neurobiological signals from an examined person are analyzed, have not been utilized for this purpose. This study is the first to propose a neuro-based decision support system to classify cognitive functions into levels, whose target is to enrich the information and indications regarding the candidate along the employee recruitment processes. We first measured relevant functional and cognitive abilities of 142 adult participants using traditional computer-based assessment, which included a battery of four tests regarding executive functions and intelligence score, consistent with actual recruitment processes. Second, using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, which is one of the dominant measurement tools in NeuroIS research, we collected the participants' brain signals by administering a resting state EEG (rsEEG) on each participant. Finally, using advanced machine and deep learning algorithms, we leveraged the collected rsEEG to classify participants' levels of executive functions and intelligence score. Our empirical analyses show encouraging results of up to 72.6% accuracy for the executive functions and up to 71.2% accuracy for the intelligence score. Therefore, this study lays the groundwork for a novel, generic (non-stimuli based) system that supports the current employee recruitment processes, that is based on psychological theories of assessing executive functions. The proposed decision support system could contribute to the development of additional medium of assessing employees remotely which is especially relevant in the current Covid-19 pandemic. While our method aims at classification rather than at explanation, our intriguing findings have the potential to push forward NeuroIS research and practice. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.\",\n",

Their goal is to invest this information using data analysis methods in order to better understand the trends of certain events. This could help them enhance the management of their allocated resources, which leads to a reduction in the operational costs, increase in efficiency and the overall intervention speed.

These data, provided by the fire department in the region of Doubs, France, were not sufficient to detect patterns. Thus, we have imported additional information from external resources that we thought it would improve the accuracy of the predictions. Finally, we tested multiple machine learning algorithms and we compared their results, aiming to determine which algorithm performs better.

Data science is useful for analysis (pattern recognition, hypothesis testing, risk valuation) and prediction. The major, primary usage of data science in the healthcare domain is in medical imaging. At the same time, lung cancer diagnosis has become a hot research topic, as automated disease detection poses numerous benefits. Although numerous approaches have existed in the literature for lung cancer diagnosis, the design of a novel model to automatically identify lung cancer is a challenging task. In this view, this paper designs an automated machine learning (ML) with data science-enabled lung cancer diagnosis and classification (MLDS-LCDC) using computed tomography (CT) images. The presented model initially employs Gaussian filtering (GF)-based pre-processing technique on the CT images collected from the lung cancer database. Besides, they are fed into the normalized cuts (Ncuts) technique where the nodule in the pre-processed image can be determined. Moreover, the oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) technique is applied as a feature extractor. At last, sunflower optimization-based wavelet neural network (SFO-WNN) model is employed for the classification of lung cancer. In order to examine the diagnostic outcome of the MLDS-LCDC model, a set of experiments were carried out and the results are investigated in terms of different aspects. The resultant values demonstrated the effectiveness of the MLDS-LCDC model over the other state-of-The-Art methods with the maximum sensitivity of 97.01%, specificity of 98.64%, and accuracy of 98.11%. ¬© 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.',\n",

While programmable and interactive interfaces such as widgets embedded within computational notebooks are suitable for these workflows, they lack robust state management capabilities and do not support user-defined customization of the interactive components. The absence of such capabilities hinders workflow reusability and transparency while limiting the scope of exploration of the end-users. In response, we developed Magneton, a framework for authoring interactive widgets within computational notebooks that enables transparent, reusable, and customizable data science workflows. The framework enhances existing widgets to support fine-grained interaction history management, reusable states, and user-defined customizations.

While recent scholarship in artificial intelligence and machine learning has focused on limiting and eliminating error, practitioners have long used error as a site of collaboration and learning vis-√†-vis labelers, domain experts, and the worlds data scientists seek to model and understand. Drawing from work in CSCW, STS, HCML, and repair studies, as well as from multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork within a government institution and a non-profit organization, we move beyond the notion of error as an edge case or anomaly to make three basic arguments. First, error discloses or calls to attention existing structures of collaboration unseen or underappreciated under 'working' systems. Second, error calls into being new forms and sites of collaboration (including, sometimes, new actors). Third, error redeploys old sites and actors in new ways, often through restructuring relations of hierarchy and expertise which recenter or devalue the position of different actors. We conclude by discussing how an artful living with error can better support the creative strategies of negotiation and adjustment which data scientists and their collaborators engage in when faced with disruption, breakdown, and friction in their work. ¬© 2023 ACM.\",\n",

       " 'There are significant predictive tool usages by design engineers in automotive industry to capture material composition and manufacturing process-induced variables. In specific, an accurate modeling of material behavior to predict the mechanical performance of a thermoplastic part is an evolving subject in this field as one needs to consider multiple factors and steps to achieve the right prediction accuracies. The variability in prediction comes from different factors such as polymer type (filled vs. unfilled, amorphous vs semi crystalline etc.), design and manufacturing features (weldline, gate locations, thickness, notches etc.), operating conditions (temperature, moisture etc.) and finally load states (tension, compression, flexural, impact etc.). Using traditional numerical simulation-based modelling to study and validate all these factors requires significant computational time and effort. An alternative method by using data science and AI-ML models is proposed to reduce the overall validation time needed for simulation. To validate this methodology, extensive part level experiments were done on a representative cylindrical geometry to accommodate all these factors using different ULTEM‚Ñ¢ Resin materials (PEI). The results show that by using neural network ML model, it is possible to accurately predict the structural response like maximum displacement and force. The ML model results were compared to the CAE based approaches and results overlapped with each other well within the 95% scatter band. By combining both the CAE modelling and ML modelling it is possible to accurately predict the critical structural response of applications more efficiently and economically. ¬© 2023 SAE International.

Data analytics enable organisations to learn how customers think and behave in real time, and make changes to their business as a consequence, using real-time insights about the customer base. The various misconceptions on data analytics, especially in organisational context, warrants the writing of this paper. Present day organisations are already under immense pressure due to increasingly competitive and hostile environments, and by utilizing data analytics may give them that extra edge over competitors in order to survive and grow. The objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of data analytics, and propose a conceptual framework to showcase the data science process as well as some of the most well-known and useful features of data analytics. This chapter also attempts to synthesise the various jargons for organisations to easily comprehend step-by-step, from data collection to producing useful data in order for them to enable informed decision-makings. ¬© 2023, IGI Global.',\n",

       " 'Improving life expectancy, which is falling and declining globally, is getting harder, especially given the limited economic resources in most parts of the world. This study seeks to identify the most significant factors that positively and negatively affect life expectancy, separating them from less significant factors. This way, specific areas can be identified to channel scarce economic resources towards increasing life expectancy. Using data science techniques on a dataset comprising economic, immunological, health, personal, and social attributes, we have been able to achieve this. Furthermore, four machine learning tree regression algorithms were employed using the identified attributes to develop and evaluate life expectancy prediction models. The extremely randomized tree model performed best using evaluation matrices: MAE, RMSE, R2, and CV score. This research can help governments, especially in low-income, developing countries, make better decisions and investments, as well as help digital health experts develop technologies that could improve life expectancy. ¬© 2023 The Author(s)',\n",
       " 'Continuous developments in data science have brought forth an exponential increase in complexity of machine learning models. Additionally, data scientists have become ubiquitous in the private market and academic environments. All of these trends are on a steady rise, and are associated with an increase in power consumption and associated carbon footprint. The increasing carbon footprint of large-scale advanced data science has already received attention, but the latter trend has not. This work aims to estimate the contribution of the increasingly popular ‚Äúcommon‚Äù data science to the global carbon footprint. To this end, the power consumption of several typical tasks in the aforementioned common data science tasks are measured and compared to: large-scale ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù data science, common computer-related tasks, and everyday non-computer related tasks. An automated data science project is also run on various hardware architectures. To assess its sustainability in terms of carbon emission, the measurements are converted to gCO2eq and an equivalent unit of ‚Äúkm driven by car‚Äù. Our main findings are: ‚Äúcommon‚Äù data science consumes 2.57 more power than regular computer usage, but less than some common everyday power-consuming tasks such as lighting or heating; advanced data science consumes substantially more power than common data science, and can be either on par or vastly surpass common everyday power-consuming tasks, depending on the scale of the project. In addition to the reporting of these results, this work also aims to inspire researchers to include power usage and estimated carbon emission as a secondary result in their work. ¬© 2023',\n",

If one claims, for instance, that information is ‚Äòmeaningful data‚Äô then it is important to note that a main objective of data science is indeed to derive meaningful information out of data. Information science is not necessarily a superset or a higher level of data science. Both of these disciplines have earned their place in sciences through different pasts, paths, and possibilities. Keeping that in mind, they are discussed here while tracing their origins and understanding their positionalities in the current context.

To date, there is not much known about the extent students are learning these skills in current civil and environmental engineering curricula. We conducted a survey of accredited civil and environmental engineering departments in the US regarding their current curricula with respect to programming and data science. Our response rate was 41% (power of 0.89 at 0.05 significance level). The results show limited incorporation of the modern data science languages (Java, Python, and R) into civil and environmental curricula, and significant use of MATLAB and spreadsheets. Although department chairs see the value of incorporating modern data science languages and facilitating student experience in the broader data science skills (e.g., understanding privacy issues, etc.) into their curricula, barriers such as faculty knowledge and lack of space in the curricula remain significant hurdles. ¬© 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.',\n",

Consequently, ADS should evolve into\\xa0data-informed ADS,\\xa0which take\\xa0humans in the loop\\xa0in all the data processing steps. Data-informed ADS should deal with data responsibly, guaranteeing nondiscrimination\\xa0with respect to protected groups of individuals. Nondiscrimination can be characterized in terms of different types of properties, like fairness and diversity. While fairness, i.e., absence of bias against minorities, has been widely investigated in machine learning, only more recently this issue has been tackled by considering all the steps of data processing pipelines at the basis of ADS, from data acquisition to analysis. Additionally, fairness is just one point of view of nondiscrimination to be considered for guaranteeing equity: other issues, like diversity, are raising interest from the scientific community due to their relevance in society. This paper aims at critically surveying how nondiscrimination has been investigated in the context of complex data science pipelines at the basis of data-informed ADS, by focusing on the specific data processing tasks for which nondiscrimination solutions have been proposed. ¬© 2022, The Author(s).',\n",

Challenges in operating computing underwater combined with a lack of high-speed communication technology covering most aquatic areas means that there is a significant delay between the collection and analysis of data. This in turn limits the scale and complexity of the applications that can operate based on these data. In this article, we develop underwater fog computing support using low-cost micro-clouds and demonstrate how they can be used to deliver cost-effective support for data-heavy underwater applications. We develop a proof-of-concept micro-cloud prototype and use it to perform extensive benchmarks that evaluate the suitability of underwater micro-clouds for diverse underwater data science scenarios. We conduct rigorous tests in both controlled and field deployments, using river and sea waters. We also address technical challenges in enabling underwater fogs, evaluating the performance of different communication interfaces and demonstrating how accelerometers can be used to detect the likelihood of communication failures and determine which communication interface to use. Our work offers a cost-effective way to increase the scale and complexity of underwater data science applications, and demonstrates how off-the-shelf devices can be adopted for this purpose. ¬© 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.',\n",

DSA was created in part because the K-12 curriculum is already packed, so deploying this informal learning environment and outreach program was one way to meet the challenge of the CS4ALL initiative and broaden participation in computing. DSA serves multiple purposes in that regard: it teaches teachers, it gives undergraduates mentoring experience, and it provides a platform for educational research and development. Currently, the DSA comprises five teaching modules, which have been repackaged and delivered as quarter or semester long weekend sessions, or shorter intensive summer programs. That is to say, the DSA accommodates flexible formats, including virtual or in-person ones and soon asynchronous options as well. The DSA provides an opportunity to develop and test lesson modules, including those derived from research projects in partnership with DS-PATH participants (an NSF project to create DS Pathways).

Metabolic profiling is most often carried out using tools that include mass spectrometry (MS), which is one of the most powerful analytical methods. All this means that even when analyzing a single sample, we can obtain thousands of data. Data science has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of plant metabolism.
