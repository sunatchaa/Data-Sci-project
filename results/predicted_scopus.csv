Materials and Methods: Oversight fell under the VA Office of Research Development (VA ORD) and DOE headquarters. An Executive Committee and 2 senior scientific liaisons work with VA and DOE leadership to optimize efforts in the service of shared scientific goals. The program supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including creation of a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes. Cross-cutting methods including natural language processing, image processing, and reusable code were developed. Results: The 79.6 million dollar collaboration has supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes and launched over 10 collaborative scientific projects in health conditions highly prevalent in veterans. A ground-breaking analysis on the Summit and Andes supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) of the genetic underpinnings of over 2000 health conditions across 44 million genetic variants which resulted in the identification of 38 270 independent genetic variants associating with one or more health traits. Of these, over 2000 identified associations were unique to non-European ancestry. Cross-cutting methods have advanced state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) including large language natural language processing and a system biology study focused on opioid addiction awarded the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. The collaboration has completed work in prostate cancer, suicide prevention, and cardiovascular disease, and cross-cutting data science. Predictive models developed in these projects are being tested for application in clinical management. Discussion: Eight new projects were launched in 2023, taking advantage of the momentum generated by the previous collaboration. A major challenge has been limitations in the scope of appropriated funds at DOE which cannot currently be used for health research. Conclusion: Extensive multidisciplinary interactions take time to establish and are essential to continued progress. New funding models for maintaining high-performance computing infrastructure at the ORNL and for supporting continued collaboration by joint VA-DOE research teams are needed. © 2024 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.",Social Sciences,
2,Regional planning: A failed or flawed project for Africa?

In theory, regional planning (the practice) is based on regional science (the field of study) from which regional policy and regional development flow. The article advances the argument that Africa did not benefit from regional science in the past due to data scarcity. However, with the advent of big data and the data deluge caused by big data, regional science and regional planning stand to benefit. We argue that with the proliferation of big data, Africa can now tap into its opportunities and correct its ‘ugly’ past regarding regional planning. With big data and artificial intelligence (AI)-tools, coupled with skilled and capable people, Africa can effectively mine data and catch up with global trends in urban and regional planning. The study concludes that there is a need to embrace big data and mine data for African regional science and regional planning to be successful. In addition, the African regional planning project was not a failure, but it suffered a stillbirth due to a lack of data and related infrastructure. © 2024 The Authors",Health Professions,

Accordingly, major theoretical advances have been provided in the literature, such as closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility certificates, for the most diverse kinds of processes descriptions. Nevertheless, identifying good, trustworthy models for complex systems is a task heavily affected by uncertainties. As of this, developing MPC algorithms directly from data has recently received a considerable amount of attention over the last couple of years. In this work, we review the available data-based MPC formulations, which range from reinforcement learning schemes, adaptive controllers, and novel solutions based on behavioural theory and trajectory representations. In particular, we examine the recent research body on this topic, highlighting the main features and capabilities of available algorithms, while also discussing the fundamental connections among approaches and, comparatively, their advantages and limitations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Biochemistry,
4,Assessment of the relationship between central venous pressure waveform and the severity of tricuspid valve regurgitation using data science,Akabane S.,Scientific Reports,2024-12-01,SCOPUS_ID:85207210995,0,True,2-s2.0-85207210995,Journal,"[{'name': 'The University of Tokyo Hospital', 'city': 'Tokyo', 'country': 'Japan'}]",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85207210995&origin=inward,"Purpose The relationship between the height of the V wave in the central venous pressure (CVP) waveform and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is well known. Their diagnostic ability is unconfirmed. This study explored CVP waveform variations with TR. Methods All patients who underwent preoperative echocardiography and CVP waveform measurements before surgery at our institution were included. Indices were created to capture each feature of the CVP waveform. The median value for each case was obtained and statistically analyzed according to the severity of TR. A deep learning technique, Transformer, was used to handle the complex features of CVP waveforms. Results This study included 436 cases. The values for C wave – Y descent, X descent – Y descent, and V wave – Y descent differed significantly in the Jonckheere–Terpstra test (p = 0.0018, 0.027, and 0.077, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for X descent – Y descent in two groups, none to moderate TR and severe TR, was 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.68, 0.98]). For Transformer, the accuracy of the validation dataset was 0.97. Conclusions The shape of the CVP waveform varied with the severity of TR in a large dataset. © The Author(s) 2024.",Medicine,
5,Data science basis and influencing factors for the evaluation of environmental safety perception in Macau parishes,Pan C.,Advances in Continuous and Discrete Models,2024-12-01,SCOPUS_ID:85205948328,0,True,2-s2.0-85205948328,Journal,"[{'name': 'Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology', 'city': 'Maoming', 'country': 'China'}]",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85205948328&origin=inward,"In the context of rapid urbanization, accurately identifying the visual factors that influence environmental safety perception is crucial for improving urban transportation environments and enhancing pedestrian safety. With the increase in urban population density and traffic flow, optimizing urban environmental design to elevate residents’ sense of safety has become a key issue in urban planning and management. However, the existing studies face numerous challenges in conducting large-scale quantitative analysis of environmental safety perception in complex scenarios, such as difficulties in data acquisition and limitations in analytical methods. This study addresses these challenges by applying image semantic segmentation and object detection techniques to extract key visual elements from street view images, combined with manual scoring and deep learning methods, to construct a road safety perception dataset. Using a LightGBM model and the SHAP interpretation framework, in this study, we identify the critical visual factors influencing environmental safety perception. An empirical study was conducted in Macau, a modern city where Eastern and Western cultures intersect, and tourism thrives. The findings reveal that: ① The overall environmental safety perception in the eight parishes and surrounding roads of Macau is relatively high, with significant regional differences in safety perception scores around Macau’s parish roads; ② The proportions of buildings, sidewalks, roads, and trees in images are the four primary factors influencing environmental safety perception; ③ The proportions and quantities of visual elements interact with each other, and their reasonable distribution helps form clear spatial visibility and creates conducive activity spaces, thereby enhancing the perception of environmental safety. Through empirical analysis, this study uncovers the mechanisms by which visual elements in urban street scenes affect environmental safety perception, providing scientific evidence for urban planning and transportation environment improvement. The research holds theoretical significance and offers practical references for urban design and management, demonstrating broad application value. © The Author(s) 2024.",Engineering,

This study tackles two issues in the field: traditional methods’ limitations due to insufficient forward modeling data, and the challenge of multiple solutions in complex scenarios. We introduce an enhanced 2D MT imaging approach with a novel self-attention mechanism, involving: 1. Generating diverse geophysical models and responses to increase data variety and volume. 2. Creating a Swin–Unet-based 2D MT Imaging network with self-attention for better modeling and relation capture, incorporating a MT sample generator using real data to lessen large-scale supervised training dependence, and refining the loss function for optimal validation. This method also includes eliminating MT background response to boost training efficiency and reduce training time. 3. Applying a transverse electric/transverse magnetic method for comprehensive 2D MT data response. Tests show that our method greatly improves 2D MT imaging’s accuracy and efficiency, with excellent generalization. © The Author(s) 2024.",Mathematics,

However, community partners often encounter challenges when interacting with data. The Community-Engaged Data Science (CEDS) model offers a goal-oriented, iterative guide for communities to collaborate with research data scientists through data ambassadors. This study presents a case study of CEDS applied to research on the opioid epidemic in 18 counties in Ohio as part of the HEALing Communities Study (HCS). Data ambassadors provided a pivotal role in empowering community coalitions to translate data into action using key steps of CEDS which included: data landscapes identifying available data in the community; data action plans from logic models based on community data needs and gaps of data; data collection/sharing agreements; and data systems including portals and dashboards. Throughout the CEDS process, data ambassadors emphasized sustainable data workflows, supporting continued data engagement beyond the HCS. The implementation of CEDS in Ohio underscored the importance of relationship building, timing of implementation, understanding communities’ data preferences, and flexibility when working with communities.

The question is then how to best benefit from recent advances in AI and how to generate, format and disseminate data to enable future breakthroughs in AI-guided drug discovery. We present here the recommendations of a working group composed of experts from both the public and private sectors. Robust data management requires precise ontologies and standardized vocabulary while a centralized database architecture across laboratories facilitates data integration into high-value datasets. Lab automation and opening electronic lab notebooks to data mining push the boundaries of data sharing and data modeling. Important considerations for building robust machine-learning models include transparent and reproducible data processing, choosing the most relevant data representation, defining the right training and test sets, and estimating prediction uncertainty. Beyond data-sharing, cloud-based computing can be harnessed to build and disseminate machine-learning models. Important vectors of acceleration for hit and chemical probe discovery will be (1) the real-time integration of experimental data generation and modeling workflows within design-make-test-analyze (DMTA) cycles openly, and at scale and (2) the adoption of a mindset where data scientists and experimentalists work as a unified team, and where data science is incorporated into the experimental design. © The Author(s) 2024.",Toxicology and Pharmaceutics,

Training healthcare specialists who are knowledgeable in both health and data sciences is highly required, important, and challenging. Therefore, it is essential to analyse students’ learning experiences through artificial intelligence techniques in order to provide both teachers and learners with insights about effective learning strategies and to improve existing HDS course designs. Methods: We applied artificial intelligence methods to uncover learning tactics and strategies employed by students in an HDS massive open online course with over 3,000 students enrolled. We also used statistical tests to explore students’ engagement with different resources (such as reading materials and lecture videos) and their level of engagement with various HDS topics. Results: We found that students in HDS employed four learning tactics, such as actively connecting new information to their prior knowledge, taking assessments and practising programming to evaluate their understanding, collaborating with their classmates, and repeating information to memorise. Based on the employed tactics, we also found three types of learning strategies, including low engagement (Surface learners), moderate engagement (Strategic learners), and high engagement (Deep learners), which are in line with well-known educational theories. The results indicate that successful students allocate more time to practical topics, such as projects and discussions, make connections among concepts, and employ peer learning. Conclusions: We applied artificial intelligence techniques to provide new insights into HDS education. Based on the findings, we provide pedagogical suggestions not only for course designers but also for teachers and learners that have the potential to improve the learning experience of HDS students. © The Author(s) 2024.",Social Sciences,

The literature identifies proper project definition as crucial for a project’s success, and also recognizes that the translation of business objectives into data-analytic problems is a difficult task. Unfortunately, common project structures, such as CRISP-DM, provide little guidance for this crucial stage when compared to subsequent project stages such as data preparation and modeling. Contribution: This paper contributes structure to the project-definition stage of data-analytic projects by proposing the Data-Analytic Problem Structure (DAPS). The diagrammatic technique facilitates the collaborative development of a consistent and precise definition of a data-analytic problem, and the articulation of how it contributes to the organization’s goals. In addition, the technique helps to identify important assumptions, and to break down large ambitions in manageable subprojects. Methods: The semi-formal specification technique took other models for problem structuring — common in fields such as operations research and business analytics — as a point of departure. The proposed technique was applied in 47 real data-analytic projects and refined based on the results, following a design-science approach. © The Author(s) 2024.",Computer Science,

It is used as a digital tool to connect with other users and also to share information and influence them for marketing and advertising purposes. The influence of popular users is broadly determined by post’s engagement rate in terms of likes, comments, and shares, and the number of followers as well. An objective and comprehensive measure of popularity is necessary to understand the factors that will help make an influencer marketing campaign more successful and beneficial for business activities. This research work attempts to take various features of an influencer account and Instagram posts dataset and develop a novel model that accurately quantifies and determines the influence of a user on Instagram. The research is based on datasets of top regional Instagram influencers and their posts based on categories signified through hashtags and captions. Our research attempts to develop a model using principal component analysis to quantify influence and using it to rank influencers. In our experiment, the proposed model after experimentation, gave the Instagram username “iqbaal.e” influence score as 874,712.9526, username “1nctdream” as 753,830.5847 and username “weareone. exo” as 668,054.4360. The proposed model ranks were compared with other ranks for Instagram users based on other measures such as follower rank etc. User names “huyitian”, “bintangemon” and “bimopd” are top social media influencers based on the proposed model for better business advertising and digital marketing outcomes with collected data and experiment context.

We propose a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to advance global knowledge about the use of economic incentives to strengthen the continuity of HIV care and accelerate global goals for HIV epidemic control. Methods: The Rudi Kundini, Pamoja Kundini study will evaluate two implementation models of an economic incentive strategy for supporting two groups of PLHIV in Tanzania. Phase 1 of the study consists of a two-arm, cluster randomized trial across 32 health facilities to assess the effectiveness of a home visit plus one-time economic incentive on the proportion of out-of-care PLHIV with viral load suppression (< 1000 copies/ml) 6 months after enrollment (n = 640). Phase 2 is an individual 1:1 randomized controlled trial designed to determine the effectiveness of a short-term counseling and economic incentive program offered to in-care PLHIV who are predicted through machine learning to be at risk of disengaging from care on the outcome of viral load suppression at 12 months (n = 692). The program includes up to three incentives conditional upon visit attendance coupled with adapted counselling sessions for this population of PLHIV. Consistent with a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study design, phase 3 is a mixed methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to strategy implementation in phases 1 and 2. Results will be used to guide optimization and scale-up of the incentive strategies, if effective, to the larger population of Tanzanian PLHIV who struggle with continuity of HIV care. Discussion: Innovative strategies that recognize the dynamic process of lifelong retention in HIV care are urgently needed. Strategies such as conditional economic incentives are a simple and effective method for improving many health outcomes, including those on the HIV continuum. If coupled with other supportive services such as home visits (phase 1) or with tailored counselling (phase 2), economic incentives have the potential to strengthen engagement among the subpopulation of PLHIV who struggle with retention in care and could help to close the gap towards reaching global “95–95-95” goals for ending the AIDS epidemic.

Through a case study of testing algorithmic systems at a transnational agency, we examine how humanitarian organizations reconcile the risks of predictive technologies with the benefits they claim to receive. Drawing on a content analysis of policy documents and interviews with humanitarian technologists, we identify three organizational strategies to justify working toward predictability: constantly seeking novel variables and data, maintaining ambiguity, and shifting models to adapt to changing circumstances. These strategies, we argue, sustain the claim that a predictable border is possible even when the technical reality of machine learning models does not live up to bureaucratic imaginaries. The so-called success of a predictable border does not solely derive from its technical capacity to estimate human mobility accurately but from creating a semblance of a predictable border inside an organization. © The Author(s) 2023.",Social Sciences,

To these ends, we designed and implemented In the Mix, a graduate student-led, two-day workshop for undergraduate students promoting collaborative science in the context of energy storage innovations. The interactive workshop was designed for future and emerging researchers to gain hands-on experience with data science, computational chemistry, and electrochemistry techniques that are critical for developing materials for battery technologies. Participants also visited commercial renewable energy facilities to help them connect discovery-based research with industry and broader societal considerations. The workshop content and structure ensured that participants experienced the interrelatedness of the fields and understood the importance of collaborative research to yield scientific advances with real-world applications. An external team evaluated the workshop and participants’ perceptions of their experiences. While our research context was energy storage, the workshop goals and outcomes are applicable to other contexts. Interdisciplinary, experiential workshops are a key avenue to broadening participation in science and research, and the ideas presented here can be readily modified for other scientific contexts and/or incorporated as broader impact activities. © 2024 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.",Chemistry,

This review addresses the critical aspects and emerging trends in LIBS, focusing on calibration challenges, integrating complementary techniques (data fusion), and applying data science for spectral analysis. Calibration is a fundamental challenge in LIBS due to matrix effects, signal drift, and variations in experimental conditions. Recent advancements aim to develop matrix-independent calibration models and employ machine learning algorithms to improve calibration accuracy and robustness. LIBS has also proven invaluable in space exploration, particularly on Mars. Instruments like ChemCam and SuperCam have successfully utilized LIBS to perform real-time chemical analysis of the Martian surface, providing critical insights into its composition and history. The review further explores the advancements in multivariate calibration techniques for handling complex and multi-component systems. Techniques such as Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are increasingly employed to address the high dimensionality of LIBS data, enhancing the precision and reliability of the analysis. In addition, combining LIBS with other instrumental analytical techniques expands its analytical capabilities. Data fusion strategies integrating LIBS with techniques like Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and hyperspectral imaging provide a more comprehensive understanding of material composition. These integrated systems, supported by sophisticated data fusion algorithms, offer unprecedented insights and accuracy. Finally, applying data science in LIBS transforms spectral inspection and analysis. Machine learning and deep learning methods are being adopted to automate and enhance the processing and interpretation of LIBS spectra, uncovering complex patterns and improving analysis accuracy. The future lies in leveraging big data analytics and real-time processing to address more complex analytical challenges. In conclusion, LIBS is evolving rapidly, driven by advancements in calibration methods, techniques integration, and data science.

This study proposes a novel method, employing information entropy, a concept from data science, to evaluate laser ablation quality. By analyzing the randomness associated with the ablation process through the distribution of a probability value (reb), we quantify the uncertainty (entropy) of the ablation. Our research reveals that higher energy levels lead to lower entropy, signifying a more controlled and predictable ablation process. Furthermore, using an interval time closer to the baseline value improves the ablation consistency. Additionally, the analysis suggests that the energy level has a stronger correlation with entropy than the baseline interval time (bit). The entropy decreased by 6.32 from 12.94 at 0.258 mJ to 6.62 at 0.378 mJ, while the change due to the bit was only 2.12 (from 10.84 at bit/2 to 8.72 at bit). This indicates that energy is a more dominant factor for predicting ablation quality. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of information entropy analysis for evaluating laser ablation, paving the way for optimizing laser parameters and achieving a more precise material removal process. © 2024 by the authors.",Medicine,

However, little is known about how interventions on the exposome, including personal behavioral modification or policy-level interventions, may impact AD/ADRD disease burden at the population level in real-world settings and the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Methods: We performed a critical review to discuss the challenges in modeling exposome interventions on population-level AD/ADRD burden and the potential of using agent-based modeling (ABM) and other advanced data science methods for causal inference to achieve this. Results: We describe how ABM can be used for empirical causal inference modeling and provide a virtual laboratory for simulating the impacts of personal and policy-level interventions. These hypothetical experiments can provide insight into the optimal timing, targeting, and duration of interventions, identifying optimal combinations of interventions, and can be augmented with economic analyses to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions. We also discuss other data science methods, including structural equation modeling and Mendelian randomization. Lastly, we discuss challenges in modeling the complex exposome, including high dimensional and sparse data, the need to account for dynamic changes over time and over the life course, and the role of exposome burden scores developed using item response theory models and artificial intelligence to address these challenges. Conclusions: This critical review highlights opportunities and challenges in modeling exposome interventions on population-level AD/ADRD disease burden while considering the cost-effectiveness of different interventions, which can be used to aid data-driven policy decisions. © 2024 by the authors.",Biochemistry,

The platform’s features and learning materials were designed based on effective online learning designs, supports for self-guided learning, and research on the teaching and learning of statistics and data science. We paid particular attention to the features we designed into the platform to support self-regulation and personalizing the experiences to meet their preferred learning goals such as allowing for free choice of learning materials, flexibility of when and how long to engage, providing personal recommendations based on user input, internal systems to track progress, and generating certificates of completion. In this study, we used a case study with both quantitative and qualitative data to examine whether teachers had gains in meeting learning goals related to their development in teaching statistics and data science, had sustained engagement, and found the features for personalization supportive for their learning. Results showed, overall, positive growth towards meeting learning goals and making small changes towards improved classroom practice. Most teachers were generally engaged in sustained ways across the study period, though we found six different patterns of completion that highlight ways in which teachers’ goal-directed and self-regulated learning occurred within the busy schedules of educators.

It is important to better characterise this input, and recent research has begun to explore corpora of narrative picture books. However, previous research has been restricted by methodological limitations that make it difficult to develop large datasets. Further, information texts become increasingly important as children progress through school, but little is known about the language of their earliest form, namely, informational picture books. The current study investigates how informational and narrative picture book exposure might change the language environment of children in a way that supports reading development. Methods: The study applies data science methods to build a larger language model than previously possible and investigates the lexical profile of over 2000 narrative and information picture books. Picture book vocabulary is innovatively derived from digital sources of books read-aloud online, which pushes the field forward by providing researchers access to larger pools of data than previously possible. Detailed comparisons of informational and narrative picture books are reported regarding their lexical diversity, density, morphology, academic vocabulary and semantic clusters. Models are developed to estimate the additional word-type exposure a child may encounter in their language environment from narrative and informational picture books. Results: The study demonstrates that information and narrative picture books expose children to substantially different semantic environments. It is demonstrated that information picture books provide extensive exposure to academic vocabulary, providing important input aligned with later reading needs. Further, computational models indicate that book reading once every day or second day over a year might boost unique-word exposure by approximately 10% for some language environments. Conclusions: Combining informational and narrative picture books enhance the language environment of children more than narratives alone, providing more lexical diversity, density and complex morphology. © 2024 The Author(s).

The purpose of this study is to explore how “sandbox” or open-inquiry data science with social media supports learning. Design/methodology/approach: This paper offers vignettes from an illustrative youth study case that highlights the pedagogical prospects and obstacles tied to designing for open-ended inquiry with computational data science to access or “scrape” Twitter/X. The youth case showcases how social media can be taken up productively and in ways that facilitate epistemological agency, an approach where individuals actively shape understanding and knowledge-creation processes, highlighting the potentially transformative impact this approach might have in empowering learners to engage productively. Findings: The authors identify three key affordances for learning that emerged from the illustrative case: (1) flexible opportunities for content-specific domain mastery, (2) situated inquiry that embodies next-generation science practices and (3) embedded computational skill development. The authors discuss these findings in relation to contemporary education needs to broaden participation in data science and computing.

The IHU processes that occur in practice are usually highly complex, both in terms of geometry and against the background of additional process steps (punching, plunging). This results in large amounts of data and complex data analyses, which are reflected in the data processing costs. A data analysis is to be carried out on the basis of a complex hydroforming process and its additional benefit for quality management and predictive maintenance is to be explained. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany.",Medicine,
41,Prediction and Scheduling System for Cayenne Pepper Planting Through Data Science Modeling Bali Saka Calendar,Wibawa I.D.A.A.A.,AIP Conference Proceedings,2024-10-18,SCOPUS_ID:85209200580,0,False,2-s2.0-85209200580,Conference Proceeding,"[{'name': 'Universitas Prasetiya Mulya', 'city': 'Jakarta', 'country': 'Indonesia'}]",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85209200580&origin=inward,"Balinese saka calendar has a system of good and bad days called Ala Ayuning Dewasa. This system included a variety of activities. One of them is cayenne pepper farming. The farmers in Bali have used the Ala Ayuning Dewasa as a guide in planting because they are believed to coincide with favorable natural conditions. However, there has been no empirical evidence regarding the suitability of the system. This study aims to begin empirical evidence by showing a correlation between this system and optimal air temperature and humidity in growing cayenne pepper. This study uses the formula y = sin(π/105° x + 90°) as a mathematical model of the Ala Ayuning Dewasa, where the maximum cycle value (y=1) represents a good day and the minimum value (y = -1) indicates a bad day. Correlation was measured against the initial assessment of the accuracy of a day as the beginning of cayenne pepper planting based on temperature and air humidity for three months after (time needed from planting to harvesting). The assessment was carried out using temperature and humidity data from October 1, 2014 to January 1, 2017. The comparison shows that there is no correlation between the two with correlation value of -0.161. However, the results of observations show that there is a similar pattern even with the beginning of a different phase. By revising the beginning of the Ala Ayuning Dewasa calendar by 60 days, the correlation value becomes 0.799. The suggestion from this initial research is to shift the beginning of Ala Ayuning Dewasa planting of cayenne pepper by 60 days to increase the correlation with optimal temperature and humidity conditions for cayenne pepper growth. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Herein, we present a data science-centric “Design–Discovery–Evaluation” scheme for exploring novel polyimides (PIs) with desired dielectric constants (3). A virtual library of over 100 000 synthetically accessible PIs is created by extending existing PIs. Within the framework of quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR), a model sufficient to predict 3 at multiple frequencies is developed with an R2of 0.9768, allowing further high-throughput screening of the prior structures with desired 3. Furthermore, the structural feature representation method of atomic adjacent group (AAG) is introduced, using which the reliability of high-throughput screening results is evaluated. This workflow identifies 9 novel PIs (3 >5 at 103Hz and glass transition temperatures between 250 °C and 350 °C) with potential applications in high-temperature capacitive energy storage, and confirms these promising findings by high-fidelity molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. © 2024 The Author(s)",Chemistry,

We hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing health disparities in access to pediatric radiology services. Objective: Evaluate the social determinants of health and sociodemographic factors related to pediatric radiology MCO before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: The study examined all outpatient pediatric radiology exams at a pediatric medical center and its affiliate centers from 03/08/19 to 06/07/21 to identify missed care opportunities. Logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis were used to explore factors and visualize relationships between social determinants and missed care opportunities. Results: A total of 62,009 orders were analyzed: 30,567 pre-pandemic, 3,205 pandemic, and 28,237 initial recovery phase. Median age was 11.34 years (IQR 5.24–15.02), with 50.8% females (31,513/62,009). MCO increased during the pandemic (1,075/3,205; 33.5%) compared to pre-pandemic (5,235/30,567; 17.1%) and initial recovery phase (4,664/28,237; 16.5%). The CART analysis identified changing predictors of missed care opportunities across different periods. Pre-pandemic, these were driven by exam-specific factors and patient age. During the pandemic, social determinants like income, distance, and ethnicity became key. In the initial recovery phase, the focus returned to exam-specific factors and age, but ethnicity continued to influence missed care, particularly in neurological exams for Hispanic patients. Logistic regression revealed similar results: during the pandemic, increased distance from the examination site (OR 1.1), residing outside the state (OR 1.57), Hispanic (OR 1.45), lower household income ($25,000–50,000 (OR 3.660) and $50,000–75,000 (OR 1.866)), orders for infants (OR 1.43), and fluoroscopy (OR 2.3) had higher odds. In the initial recovery phase, factors such as living outside the state (OR 1.19), orders for children (OR 0.79), and being Hispanic (OR 1.15) correlate with higher odds of MCO. Conclusion: The application of basic data science techniques is a valuable tool in uncovering complex relationships between sociodemographic factors and disparities in pediatric radiology, offering crucial insights into addressing inequalities in care.

The purpose of our article is to research and forecast prices for agricultural products using the example of potato prices based on the most effective models using data science techniques. Methodology / approach. Various forecasting models are explored, starting from baseline models like decomposition and exponential smoothing models to more advanced techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, as well as deep learning models including neural network. The data is split into training and testing sets, and models are validated using cross-validation techniques and optimised through hyperparameter tuning. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE. The selected model is then used to generate future price forecasts, with uncertainty quantified through confidence intervals. Results. The study successfully applied advanced data science techniques to forecast potato prices, leveraging a range of effective models. By analysing historical price data and using various forecasting methods, the research identified the most accurate models for predicting future price trends. The results demonstrate that the selected models can provide reliable forecasts. In particular, the results showed that the SARIMA (1,0,0)(0,1,1)[12] model could achieve good forecast results when applied to real problems and, thus, can be effectively used for forecasting tasks especially considering seasonality. In addition, it should be noted that the ETS (M, Ad, A) model has a higher prediction accuracy at the time intervals closest to the original data. The obtained results support using both models simultaneously for forecasting, which can compensate for the shortcomings of each of them. The models can be used separately, to more accurately predict the values for the required period, or a combination of them is also possible. Originality / scientific novelty. The study’s originality lies in development of methods for effectively accounting for seasonality in agricultural price data, such as using seasonal decomposition techniques or more advanced techniques that combine statistical and data science approaches. The novelty implies the implementation of real-time data processing and forecasting system allows for the timely prediction of price changes, enabling stakeholders to make more informed decisions. Practical value / implications. Forecasting potato prices holds significant practical value for various stakeholders. For farmers, accurate forecasts enable informed decisions on the optimal times to plant, harvest, and sell their crops, thereby optimising their profits. In the supply chain, distributors and retailers can use these forecasts to manage inventory more effectively and plan contracts, reducing waste and avoiding shortages. Policymakers benefit from forecasts by anticipating market fluctuations and stabilising prices, which supports both consumers and producers. For consumers, stable pricing ensures better budgeting and helps avoid sudden price spikes, making essential foods more affordable. Overall, accurate price forecasting enhances market efficiency by reducing uncertainty and aiding investors in managing risk. © 2024, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

Additionally, in recent years, bioinformatics has surfaced as an integral discipline in life sciences, where scientists are able to manipulate and analyze large sets of data. As a result, the need for digitally enhanced undergraduate and graduate teaching of basic bioinformatics skill sets of an applied nature has become increasingly high. Here, we designed and implemented a set of video-based bioinformatics tutorials as an open educational resource to be taught in an online synchronous, asynchronous, as well as HyFlex setting. These tutorials were designed to identify a ligand against unknown amino acid and nucleotide sequences to unveil their context in diverse species. This was achieved by navigating online bioinformatic databases, performing multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analyses, protein structure prediction/comparison, and docking. In the end, students also completed a survey questionnaire outlining their experience with the VBL. By the end of the term, VBL enabled the students to learn and apply bioinformatic concepts and tools to predict the protein structure from an unknown sequence and dock it with the ligands. Students rated VBL as one of the most powerful learning mediums out of many used as part of the module. Bioinformatic videos, besides capturing and distributing the bioinformatic information, also provided an invigorating environment where students better learned, understood, and retained the content.

Utilization of these LLMs to study the epidemiology of a target population could benefit urologists. We investigated whether Bard and ChatGPT can perform a large-scale calculation of the incidence and prevalence of kidney stone disease. Materials and Methods: We obtained reference values from two published studies, which used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database to calculate the prevalence and incidence of kidney stone disease. We then tested the capability of Bard and ChatGPT to perform similar calculations using two different methods. First, we instructed the LLMs to access the data sets and independently perform the calculation. Second, we instructed the interfaces to generate a customized computer code, which could perform the calculation on downloaded data sets. Results: While ChatGPT denied the ability to access and perform calculations on the NHANES database, Bard intermittently claimed the ability to do so. Bard provided either accurate results or inaccurate and inconsistent results. For example, Bard’s ‘‘calculations’’ for the incidence of kidney stones from 2015 to 2018 were 2.1% (95% CI 1.5–2.7), 1.75% (95% CI 1.6–1.9), and 0.8% (95% CI 0.7–0.9), while the published number was 2.1% (95% CI 1.5–2.7). Bard provided discrete mathematical details of its calculations, however, when prompted further, admitted to having obtained the numbers from online sources, including our chosen reference articles, rather than from a de novo calculation. Both LLMs were able to produce a code (Python) to use on the downloaded NHANES data sets, however, these would not readily execute.

Design: Retrospective cohort study across 12 databases in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network. Subjects: Subjects aged ≥ 18 years with ≥ 3 monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF medications for a blinding disease (diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, exudative age-related macular degeneration, or retinal vein occlusion). Methods: The standardized incidence proportions and rates of kidney failure while on treatment with anti-VEGF were calculated. For each comparison (e.g., aflibercept versus ranibizumab), patients from each group were matched 1:1 using propensity scores. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of kidney failure while on treatment. A random effects meta-analysis was performed to combine each database's hazard ratio (HR) estimate into a single network-wide estimate. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of kidney failure while on anti-VEGF treatment, and time from cohort entry to kidney failure. Results: Of the 6.1 million patients with blinding diseases, 37 189 who received ranibizumab, 39 447 aflibercept, and 163 611 bevacizumab were included; the total treatment exposure time was 161 724 person-years. The average standardized incidence proportion of kidney failure was 678 per 100 000 persons (range, 0–2389), and incidence rate 742 per 100 000 person-years (range, 0–2661). The meta-analysis HR of kidney failure comparing aflibercept with ranibizumab was 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70–1.47; P = 0.45), ranibizumab with bevacizumab 0.95 (95% CI, 0.68–1.32; P = 0.62), and aflibercept with bevacizumab 0.95 (95% CI, 0.65–1.39; P = 0.60). Conclusions: There was no substantially different relative risk of kidney failure between those who received ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept. Practicing ophthalmologists and nephrologists should be aware of the risk of kidney failure among patients receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF medications and that there is little empirical evidence to preferentially choose among the specific intravitreal anti-VEGF agents.

With innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) predicting such diseases early is very important research area. With learning based approaches that exploit knowledge from given samples, it is possible to improve disease prediction process. There are many aspects to proper healthcare such as preventing diseases with suitable diet and lifestyle, early detection of diseases if any and efficient treatment. Data is being accumulated in every domain. However, the healthcare industry is on top of the list as it provides large volumes of data pertaining to human health, diet and drug aspects. The existing literature has not shown adequate research in this direction. The Healthcare industry has an unprecedented impact on the well-being of people across the globe. In the recent observations by World Health Organization (WHO), data science approach towards disease prediction greatly complements existing Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs).This research paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of data science techniques for disease prediction and drug recommendation in healthcare, focusing on a case study involving cardiovascular diseases. The primary objective of this study is to develop a robust predictive model that identifies the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases in patients, and subsequently recommends drug interventions for optimal treatment outcomes. Here we propose Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation Framework (DPDRF). The framework is realized by defining an algorithm known as Cardio Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation (CDP-DR). The Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation algorithm in turn uses different supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). Another algorithm known as Entropy and Gain based Hybrid Feature Selection (EG-HFS) is defined to leverage quality of training leading to performance enhancement of prediction models. The experimental results with cardio disease prediction as a case study revealed that the proposed framework is useful in disease prediction and drug recommendations by using different prediction models.

While there is widespread agreement on the importance of teaching ethics within computing contexts, there is no clear method for its implementation and assessment. Studies focusing on methods for integrating ethics into data science courses reveal that students tend to neglect ethical concerns in their data analysis. Based on the data we collected from questionnaires distributed to undergraduate science and engineering students, this paper expands the discussion beyond human concerns and ethics in data science education. As we will show, students tend to neglect the context when attempting to solve data science questions. We argue that gaps in understanding the context relating to the data result in gaps in the analysis as well as in the interpretation of the data. Thus, we propose anthropological thinking as a pedagogy to overcome the context neglect. Placing the spotlight on the context promotes a holistic understanding of the phenomenon being analyzed, as it includes important considerations that do not necessarily fit the more commonly used term human concerns. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Social Sciences,

This article investigates the impact of four winsorization statistics (mean, median, mode, and quantiles) on parameter estimation through an extensive simulation study. Three probability distributions (normal, negative binomial, and exponential) are considered, each with varying degrees of contamination. The simulation results suggest that winsoriza-tion is effective for small contamination levels and large sample sizes. Furthermore, it is recommended to winsorize outliers in symmetric distributions using any of the location parameters. However, for asymmetric distributions, the median should be employed. To illustrate these findings, a real dataset on internet usage session durations for 4,500 users, comprising over 2 million records, are fitted to the exponential distribution.

One vital feld is data science, including feature engineering (FE), where both human ingenuity and AI capabilities play pivotal roles. Despite the existence of AI-generated recommendations for FE, there remains a limited understanding of how to efectively integrate and utilize humans’ and AI’s knowledge. To address this gap, we design a readily-usable prototype, human&AI-assisted FE in Jupyter notebooks. It harnesses the strengths of humans and AI to provide feature suggestions to users, seamlessly integrating these recommendations into practical workfows. Using the prototype as a research probe, we conducted an exploratory study to gain valuable insights into data science practitioners’ perceptions, usage patterns, and their potential needs when presented with feature suggestions from both humans and AI. Through qualitative analysis, we discovered that the “Creator” of the feature (i.e., AI or human) signifcantly infuences users’ feature selection, and the semantic clarity of the suggested feature greatly impacts its adoption rate. Furthermore, our fndings indicate that users perceive both diferences and complementarity between features generated by humans and those generated by AI. Lastly, based on our study results, we derived a set of design recommendations for future human&AI FE design.

The proposed framework encompasses data analysis, pre-processing, feature engineering, feature selection, the use and comparison of diverse machine learning forecasting algorithms, and validation. A real-world dataset from a CS in Boulder City is employed to evaluate the framework’s effectiveness, and the results demonstrate its proficiency in predicting the EVs’ plugged-in status, with XGBoost’s classifier achieving remarkable accuracy with an F1-score of 0.97. Furthermore, an in-depth evaluation of six regression methods highlighted the supremacy of gradient boosting algorithms in forecasting the EVs’ power consumption, with LightGBM emerging as the most effective method due to its optimal balance between prediction accuracy with a 4.22% normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) and computational efficiency with 5 s of execution time.

As cities around the world continue to grow, it is important for urban planners and policy makers to understand how different urban configuration patterns affect the environment and human health. However, previous studies have provided mixed findings. We aimed to identify European urban configuration types, on the basis of the local climate zones categories and street design variables from Open Street Map, and evaluate their association with motorised traffic flows, surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensities, tropospheric NO2, CO2per person emissions, and age-standardised mortality. Methods: We considered 946 European cities from 31 countries for the analysis defined in the 2018 Urban Audit database, of which 919 European cities were analysed. Data were collected at a 250 m × 250 m grid cell resolution. We divided all cities into five concentric rings based on the Burgess concentric urban planning model and calculated the mean values of all variables for each ring. First, to identify distinct urban configuration types, we applied the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction method, followed by the k-means clustering algorithm. Next, statistical differences in exposures (including SUHI) and mortality between the resulting urban configuration types were evaluated using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by a post-hoc Dunn's test. Findings: We identified four distinct urban configuration types characterising European cities: compact high density (n=246), open low-rise medium density (n=245), open low-rise low density (n=261), and green low density (n=167). Compact high density cities were a small size, had high population densities, and a low availability of natural areas. In contrast, green low density cities were a large size, had low population densities, and a high availability of natural areas and cycleways. The open low-rise medium and low density cities were a small to medium size with medium to low population densities and low to moderate availability of green areas. Motorised traffic flows and NO2exposure were significantly higher in compact high density and open low-rise medium density cities when compared with green low density and open low-rise low density cities. Additionally, green low density cities had a significantly lower SUHI effect compared with all other urban configuration types. Per person CO2emissions were significantly lower in compact high density cities compared with green low density cities. Lastly, green low density cities had significantly lower mortality rates when compared with all other urban configuration types. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that, although the compact city model is more sustainable, European compact cities still face challenges related to poor environmental quality and health. Our results have notable implications for urban and transport planning policies in Europe and contribute to the ongoing discussion on which city models can bring the greatest benefits for the environment, climate, and health.

This line of research goes (via representation) from abstract concepts to data. In this paper we would like to take the opposite direction: from data (via construction) to consequence relations. The main emphasis is laid here not on general categories of consequence relations (e.g. Scott or Tarski ones) but on concrete operators that can be retrieved from information systems (e.g. different examples of Scott consequence). To this end, we employ Galois connections and adjunctions (en masse called Galois mappings) and study the consequence relations that can be built via these maps. The main novelty of our research comes from the investigation of consequence relations induced by adjunctions rather than monotone Galois connections, which have been the main subject of studies so far.

Intelligent discovery assistants (IDAs) and automated machine learning (AutoML) solutions aim to facilitate end-users by (semi-)automating the process. However, they are expensive to compute and yield limited applicability for a wide range of real-world use cases and application domains. This is due to (a) their need to execute thousands of pipelines to get the optimal one, (b) their limited support of DS tasks, e.g., supervised classification or regression only, and a small, static set of available data preprocessing and ML algorithms; and (c) their restriction to quantifiable evaluation processes and metrics, e.g., tenfold cross-validation using the ROC AUC score for classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose a human-in-the-loop approach for the assisteddesignofdatasciencepipelines using previously executed pipelines. Based on a user query, i.e., data and a DS task, our framework outputs a ranked list of pipeline candidates from which the user can choose to execute or modify in real time. To recommend pipelines, it first identifies relevant datasets and pipelines utilizing efficient similarity search. It then ranks the candidate pipelines using multi-objective sorting and takes user interactions into account to improve suggestions over time. In our experimental evaluation, the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art IDA tool and achieves similar predictive performance with state-of-the-art long-running AutoML solutions while being real-time, generic to any evaluation processes and DS tasks, and extensible to new operators. © The Author(s) 2024.",Computer Science,

Most of the classic approaches to data processing consist of studying the consequences of phenomena rather than the factors of their appearance. At the same time, the factors affecting the behavior of the investigated process are assumed to be random and are not investigated. The article discusses the approach to forecasting the parameters of the trend of statistical time se-ries, which consists of the study of factors that lead to changes in the dynamics of the studied process. This approach potentially has better indicators of adequacy, ac-curacy, and efficiency in obtaining final solutions than classical approaches.

Modern ER notation has evolved with UML symbols to represent both entities (logical level) and relational tables (physical level). On the other hand, flow diagrams (flowcharts, process flow) remain an important mechanism to visualize the main steps of a data processing pipeline. However, in modern data science projects there is a significant fraction of data that does not come from databases or data that is exported outside the database system, being processed by Python code, without any data model whatsoever. In this paper, we present a novel diagram which is built from source code and its associated browser-based GUI for collaborating on data integration and data preprocessing, mixing diverse data sources and diverse programming languages (mainly Python and SQL). Specifically, our targets are data integration, data cleaning and data transformation, which are needed to derive data sets that can be used as input for a machine learning model. We present a couple of target applications and a preliminary GUI, which partially automates diagram creation. We show our diagram has promise understanding, extending and reusing both data preparation source code and data sets. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Computer Science,

We propose explanations for preprocessing pipelines that express the impact of each step on the resulting model behavior based on existing feature attribution methods. In the process, we introduce two related but distinct measures of impact for preprocessing steps: Leave-out Impact (What do we lose/gain by leaving out this step?) and Immediate Impact (What do we lose/gain by adding this step at this time?). Both are obtained by constructing variations of the original pipeline and comparing the resulting model behavior represented as feature importance vectors. These measures reflect the intuition of impact but also express the effects of a step and its interactions with the rest of the pipeline on the internal workings of the trained model. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Computer Science,

Recent breakthroughs in IoT, mobile and fixed communications and computation have paved the way for a data-centric society of the future. New applications are increasingly reliant on machine-to-machine connections, resulting in unusual workloads and the need for more efficient and dependable infrastructures. Such a wide range of traffic workloads and applications will necessitate dynamic and highly adaptive network environments capable of self-optimization for the task at hand while ensuring high dependability and ultra-low latency. Networking devices, sensors, agents, meters and smart vehicles/systems generate massive amounts of data, necessitating new levels of security, performance and dependability. Such complications necessitate the development of new tools and approaches for providing successful services, management and operation. Predictive network analytics will play a critical role in insight generation, process automation required for adapting and scaling to new demands, resolving issues before they impact operational performance (e.g., preventing network failures and anticipating capacity requirements) and overall network decision-making. To increase user experience and service quality, data mining and analytic techniques for inferring quality of experience (QoE) signals are required. AI, IoT, machine learning, reinforcement learning and network data analytics innovations open new possibilities in areas such as channel modeling and estimation, cognitive communications, interference alignment, mobility management, resource allocation, network control and management, network tomography, multi-agent systems and network ultra-broadband deployment prioritization.

This study delves into the intricacies of fishing tourism through the lens of data science, leveraging web crawling techniques to gather extensive data from reviewer profiles on TripAdvisor. By employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the study investigates the correlation between Experience Economy dimensions and user profiling aspects within this domain. The findings of this study shed light on the predominant dimensions of the Experience Economy within fishing tourism. “Entertainment” emerges as the primary dimension, closely followed by “Aesthetic”, “Educational”, and “Escapist” elements. Notably, the study reveals frequent co-occurrences of certain dimension pairs, such as “Entertainment”–“Aesthetic” and “Educational”–“Entertainment”, underscoring the multifaceted nature of the fishing tourism experience. The implications of this research extend beyond academic discourse to practical considerations for stakeholders in the fishing tourism sector. By highlighting the socioeconomic benefits inherent in fishing tourism for local communities and fishers, the study emphasizes the importance of governmental support. This support, in the form of infrastructure development, effective leadership, legislative measures, and financial backing, is deemed essential for fostering sustainable growth and development in this sector. This study stands as a pioneering endeavor within the realm of fishing tourism research, particularly in its focus on Experience Economy dimensions and user profiling. By drawing data from both business pages and user profiles on TripAdvisor, it provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between tourist experiences and the broader economic and social landscape of fishing tourism destinations. © 2024 by the authors.",Computer Science,

This methodology is appealing as well for the domain of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, particularly for interactively developing new methodologies and workflows. However, effective use of literate programming is hampered by old programming paradigms and the difficulties associated with using high performance computing (HPC) resources. Here we present two Python libraries that aim to remove these hurdles. First, we describe the PyBigDFT library, which can be used to setup materials or molecular systems and provides high-level access to the wavelet based BigDFT code. We then present the related remotemanager library, which is able to serialize and execute arbitrary Python functions on remote supercomputers. We show how together these libraries enable transparent access to HPC based DFT calculations and can serve as building blocks for rapid prototyping and data exploration. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Physics and Astronomy,

We present several specific metrics to report to targeted audiences to tell the story for success of a robust and sustainable program. While gathering such metrics includes challenges, we discuss potential data sources and possible practices for SDSPs to inform their own approaches. Emphasizing essential metrics for reporting, we also share the metric gathering and reporting practices of two programs in greater detail. New or existing SDSPs should evaluate their local environments and tailor their practice to gathering, analysing and reporting success metrics accordingly. This approach provides a strong foundation to use success metrics to tell compelling stories about the SDSP and enhance program sustainability. The area of success metrics provides ample opportunity for future research projects that leverage qualitative methods and consider mechanisms for adapting to the changing landscape of data science. © 2024 The Authors.

The service addresses the needs of university researchers who possess domain knowledge in their fields of study but a skills gap in the data science competencies required for research. The literature shows that it has been difficult for libraries to cover these needs with existing staffing models. Few universities follow the model practiced at NC State University, so a scan of the current landscape of data science consulting at universities across the country was performed to establish context. The support model and its advantages are described, including partnership with the DSA, student success, model sustainability and future directions for the service. Through a summary of the DVS assessment and needs evaluation process, the service's advantages in staying ahead of patron needs are illustrated. This scalable, sustainable, student-focused model could be implemented by similar research institutions to expand the capacity of their technical research services. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study examined the impact behaviour of AP crystal sizes between 200 and 400 μm by varying impact velocities between 3 and 10 m/s. Based on the outcome of CFEM simulations, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests and a response surface method (RSM) were utilized to construct a mathematical model approximating the relationships between simulation inputs and outcomes. Both computational and experimental results show that the local strain rate has a considerable positive correlation with crystal size, and the rate of temperature change has positive correlations with both crystal size and impact velocity. Further, it was observed that stiffness and compression energy are the primary factors to variances in local strain rate and rate of change of temperature. RSM has been found to be an effective tool for modelling impact responses of materials under varying experimental conditions. © 2023 The Authors.

Data science techniques, such as sentiment or emotion analysis which analyse textual emotion, provide an opportunity to gather insight from social media. This paper describes a systematic scoping review of interdisciplinary evidence to explore how sentiment or emotion analysis methods alongside other data science methods have been used to examine nutrition, food and cooking social media content. A PRISMA search strategy was used to search nine electronic databases in November 2020 and January 2022. Of 7325 studies identified, thirty-six studies were selected from seventeen countries, and content was analysed thematically and summarised in an evidence table. Studies were published between 2014 and 2022 and used data from seven different social media platforms (Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest, Sina Weibo and mixed platforms). Five themes of research were identified: dietary patterns, cooking and recipes, diet and health, public health and nutrition and food in general. Papers developed a sentiment or emotion analysis tool or used available open-source tools. Accuracy to predict sentiment ranged from 33·33% (open-source engine) to 98·53% (engine developed for the study). The average proportion of sentiment was 38·8% positive, 46·6% neutral and 28·0% negative. Additional data science techniques used included topic modelling and network analysis. Future research requires optimising data extraction processes from social media platforms, the use of interdisciplinary teams to develop suitable and accurate methods for the subject and the use of complementary methods to gather deeper insights into these complex data. © The Author(s), 2023.

Previous research suggests that how others respond can be an important determinant of the sharer's affective and well-being outcomes. However, less is known about whether and how cues embedded in the content of what is shared can shape the type of responses that one receives from others, obscuring the joint and interactive role that both the sharer and listener may play in influencing the sharer's outcomes. In this study, we develop theory to advance our understanding of online coping with an explicitly social focus using computational grounded theorizing and machine learning (ML) techniques applied to a large corpus of work-related conversations on Reddit. Specifically, our theoretical model sheds light on the dynamics of the online social coping process related to the domain of work. We show that how sharers and listeners interact and react to one another depends on the content of stressors shared, the social coping behaviors used when sharing, and whether the sharer and listener belong to the same occupational context. We contribute to the social coping literature in three ways. First, we clarify how social actors respond to cues embedded in the social coping attempt. Second, we examine the moderating role that such responses play in shaping sharer outcomes. Finally, we extend theory on social coping with work-related stressors to the online domain. Taken together, this research highlights the importance of the dynamic interplay between sharer and listener in the context of online social coping. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Psychology,

It is important to study student satisfaction to understand how students feel about the quality of education, academic experiences, access to facilities, campus life, and extracurricular activities. A questionnaire was designed for the study, and data was collected from 81 students enrolled in master’s and PhD programs at the African Centre of Excellence in Data Science. In this study, a chi-square test was conducted to select factors associated with students’ satisfaction to be included in the model, and a multivariable logistic regression model was used for the analysis. The findings indicated that gender, level of study, programme of study, and the country of origin were not associated with student satisfaction. In contrast, curriculum relevance, accessing course materials, learning facilities, and the support from the ACE were statistically associated with students’ satisfaction. Therefore, the logistic regression model solely took into account variables which are associated with students’ satisfaction. This study uncovered the difficulties and opportunities affecting students’ satisfaction, and the findings showed that accessing course materials and satisfaction with centre support were statistically significant, while curriculum relevance and satisfaction with learning facilities were not.

Due to the rapid development of data science (DS), promising progress has been made in the transition toward CE in the past decade. DS offers various methods to achieve accurate predictions, accelerate product sustainable design, prolong asset life, optimize the infrastructure needed to circulate materials, and provide evidence-based insights. Despite the exciting scientific advances in this field, there still lacks a comprehensive review on this topic to summarize past achievements, synthesize knowledge gained, and navigate future research directions. In this paper, we try to summarize how DS accelerated the transition to CE. We conducted a critical review of where and how DS has helped the CE transition with a focus on four areas including (1) characterizing socioeconomic metabolism, (2) reducing unnecessary waste generation by enhancing material efficiency and optimizing product design, (3) extending product lifetime through repair, and (4) facilitating waste reuse and recycling. We also introduced the limitations and challenges in the current applications and discussed opportunities to provide a clear roadmap for future research in this field. © 2024 American Chemical Society",Environmental Science,

In this framework, we aim at providing data scientists with facilities to gain an in-depth understanding of how each step in the pipeline affects the data, from the raw input to training sets ready to be used for learning. Starting from an extensible set of data preparation operators commonly used within a data science setting, in this work we present a provenance management infrastructure for generating, storing, and querying very granular accounts of data transformations, at the level of individual elements within datasets whenever possible. Then, from the formal definition of a core set of data science preprocessing operators, we derive a provenance semantics embodied by a collection of templates expressed in PROV, a standard model for data provenance. Using those templates as a reference, our provenance generation algorithm generalises to any operator with observable input/output pairs. We provide a prototype implementation of an application-level provenance capture library to produce, in a semiautomatic way, complete provenance documents that account for the entire pipeline. We report on the ability of that reference implementation to capture provenance in real ML benchmark pipelines and over TCP-DI synthetic data. We finally show how the collected provenance can be used to answer a suite of provenance benchmark queries that underpin some common pipeline inspection questions, as expressed on the Data Science Stack Exchange. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The key step is a nickel-catalyzed reduction of the corresponding enol tosylates that predominantly relies on a monophosphine ligand to direct the stereoconvergent formation of either the E- or Z-trisubstituted alkene products. Reaction optimization was accomplished using a data science workflow including monophosphine training set design, statistical modeling, and multiobjective Bayesian optimization. The optimization campaign significantly improved access to both the E- and Z-trisubstituted products in up to ∼90:10 diastereoselectivity and >90% yield. After identifying superior ligands using training set design, only 25 reactions were required for each objective (E- and Z-isomer formation) to converge on improved reaction parameters from a search space of ∼30,000 potential conditions using the EDBO+ platform. Additionally, a hierarchical machine learning model was developed to predict the stereoselectivity of untested monophosphine ligands to achieve a validation mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.1% selectivity (0.21 kcal/mol). Ultimately, we present a synergistic data science workflow leveraging the integration of training set design, statistical modeling, and Bayesian optimization, thereby expanding access to stereodefined trisubstituted alkenes. © 2024 American Chemical Society",Chemical Engineering,

In this paper, we demonstrate that multiscale entropy (MSE) is pivotal in describing the steady state of complex systems. Introducing the multiscale entropy dynamics (MED) methodology, we provide a framework for dissecting system dynamics and uncovering the driving forces behind their evolution. Our investigation reveals that the MED methodology facilitates the expression of complex system dynamics through a Generalized Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (GNSE) that thus demonstrates its potential applicability across diverse complex systems.

DESIGN: Scoping review and expert opinion. SETTING: We queried CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCO), Cochrane Library (Wiley), Embase (Elsevier), Ovid Medline, and PubMed for articles published between 2000 and 2022 related to machine learning concepts and pediatric critical illness. Articles were excluded if the majority of patients were adults or neonates, if unsupervised machine learning was the primary methodology, or if information related to the development, validation, and/or implementation of the model was not reported. Article selection and data extraction were performed using dual review in the Covidence tool, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. SUBJECTS: Articles reporting on the development, validation, or implementation of supervised machine learning models in the field of pediatric critical care medicine. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 5075 identified studies, 141 articles were included. Studies were primarily (57%) performed at a single site. The majority took place in the United States (70%). Most were retrospective observational cohort studies. More than three-quarters of the articles were published between 2018 and 2022. The most common algorithms included logistic regression and random forest. Predicted events were most commonly death, transfer to ICU, and sepsis. Only 14% of articles reported external validation, and only a single model was implemented at publication. Reporting of validation methods, performance assessments, and implementation varied widely. Follow-up with authors suggests that implementation remains uncommon after model publication. CONCLUSIONS: Publication of supervised machine learning models to address clinical challenges in pediatric critical care medicine has increased dramatically in the last 5 years. While these approaches have the potential to benefit children with critical illness, the literature demonstrates incomplete reporting, absence of external validation, and infrequent clinical implementation. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Accurate modeling of solid particles and fluids within these beds is essential for process optimization and improved efficiency. In this study, we developed a machine learning model to predict the coefficient of restitution (COR) of solid particles in fluidized beds. Four variables—collision velocity, effective temperature, effective mass, and effective elastic modulus—were used in the model. Our dataset comprised 2446 data points from previous literature. We employed self-organizing map (SOM) and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches for data analysis. The initial ANN model, which did not incorporate data clustering, exhibited an impressive coefficient of determination (R-squared) of 0.989, indicating its high accuracy. To enhance the model further, we clustered the data into four groups using SOM and developed separate ANN models for each group. All four models achieved R-squared greater than 0.99, illustrating the effectiveness of data clustering. The resulting model can be integrated into simulation software, such as MFIX, to provide a more precise representation of fluidized bed behavior across various industrial settings. The findings emphasize the potential of machine learning models to enhance fluidized bed simulations, leading to increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness in industrial processes. Future studies should explore the inclusion of additional variables and extend the model's application to different industrial processes. Additionally, incorporating recommendations for optimizing fluidized bed behavior based on the model's predictions would provide valuable insights for process engineers. © 2024 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Its proper disposal and resource utilization is a key challenge. High-temperature melt vitrification technology is an effective solution to realize the detoxification and resource utilization of HMHW. This paper summarizes and analyzes the control parameters of the existing vitrification treatment of HMHW. The phase transformation process of temperature, slag content, and CAS ratio (CaO-Al2O3-SiO2) in the vitrification treatment of zinc leaching residue (ZLR) was investigated around the vitreous content. The common evolution characteristics of the formed vitrification products in infrared spectrum, UV–vis diffuse reflection spectrum, and microstructures were revealed. The idea of using the maximum UV–vis absorption intensity to qualitatively determine the vitreous content of the products is proposed. Moreover, the correlation between experimental parameters and vitreous content was quantified by combining the data science method, and the mapping of the whole process of ZLR vitrification treatment was constructed. This work provides reliable parameter guidance and method induction for the vitrification treatment of HMHW, especially for wastes with less glassy matrix such as Ca and Si. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Chemical Engineering,

However, knowledge gap remains as which level satellite data should be used as the critical proxy variable, and how to improve data-driven models with domain knowledge are also still elusive. By taking surface NO2concentration mapping as illustration, here we performed inter-comparison studies between a set of machine-learned surface NO2concentration estimation models established with different levels of satellite products, varying from Level 1 (L1) apparent radiance from TROPOMI on board Sentinel-5p to Level 2 (L2) NO2slant column density (SCD) and tropospheric vertical column density (VCD). TROPOMI bands sensitive to surface NO2were firstly pinpointed via radiative transfer simulations while band ratios between nine sensitive and adjacent insensitive channels were then calculated and used as the counterpart of raw radiance observations. The results indicated that the prediction model trained with L1 band ratios at few discrete channels yielded higher prediction accuracy (R2= 0.71, RMSE = 7.98 μg m−3) than that using raw L1 radiance data at all available bands (R2= 0.68, RMSE = 8.40 μg m−3), largely benefiting from the improved signal-to-noise ratio and reduced model complexity due to fewer band ratio inputs. Yet even higher modeling accuracies were attained with L2 data products, the model with SCD (R2= 0.78, RMSE = 6.54 μg m−3) were found to perform even slightly better than that of VCD (R2= 0.77, RMSE = 6.79 μg m−3), though the latter is supposed to better correlate with surface NO2variations. The modeling accuracy was further improved with the inclusion of solar zenith angle, aerosol optical depth, surface albedo and pressure that are highly associated with air mass factor, with R2improved to 0.80 and RMSE reduced to 6.28 μg m−3. Overall, our results not only provide actional guidance on satellite-based surface NO2concentration modeling but also underscore the critical importance of domain knowledge in improving machine-learned models to aid in large scale air quality surveillance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Science,

Of course, the need for proficient people in this field is growing in demand by many businesses, including large corporations. Data science is a science that combines expertise in a particular field of science with programming, mathematics, and statistics skills. The goal is to extract knowledge or information from data. The problem that usually occurs in the data science process is at the data modeling stage, namely the accuracy of the mathematical model that will be used to obtain the estimated parameter values. To overcome this problem, this research was conducted to test the correctness of analytic derivatives in mathematical models and conduct data modeling using analytic derivatives that have been tested to obtain the estimated value of each parameter. The validation process is carried out using an analytic and numeric gradient comparison. If the comparison of the two values is close to zero, then the analytical derivatives used are correct. The parameter estimation method used is the Maximum Likelihood Estimation. In this research, it was concluded that the value of the analytic gradient is the same or close to the numeric gradient value for each parameter so that the analytic derivatives are correct and can be used for the next stage. With the results of this research, the expected implication is to get more accurate data modeling so that the conclusions obtained are more precise. © 2024 Author(s).",Computer Science,

A country's progress in catching up with other countries also depends heavily on two other factors, namely the quality of institutions and the availability of infrastructure. The universities must create the next generation of the nation that can lay the foundation for Indonesia to become a developed country. However, since the Covid-19 pandemic, this situation has dramatically affected the learning process in universities. To prevent the spread of Covid-19 in Indonesia, the government has implemented a hybrid learning system for higher education levels. This hybrid system requires Internet access by students and faculty to help support the learning process from campus. However, the current hybrid system has not effectively and efficiently replaced formal education. Therefore, the research team took the initiative to conduct this study to observe the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on learning outcomes through regression analysis with single and multiple predictors. The method used is regression analysis, where the parameter estimation uses the Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The regression model with single and multiple predictors resulted in the same conclusion. The relationship between the predictor variables and the responses was positive. With the results of this study, the expected implication is the utilization of the developed model to obtain policy-making scenarios by the university to achieve the targets. © 2024 Author(s).",Computer Science,

The present 4IR era gave birth to big data sets and is beyond real estate professionals' analysis techniques. This has led to a situation where most real estate professionals rely on their intuition while neglecting a rigorous analysis for real estate investment appraisals. The heavy reliance on their intuition has been responsible for the under-performance of real estate investment, especially in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilised a survey questionnaire to randomly source data from real estate professionals. The questionnaire was analysed using a combination of Statistical package for social science (SPSS) V24 and Analysis of a Moment Structures (AMOS) graphics V27 software. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to break down the variables (drivers) into meaningful dimensions helpful in developing the conceptual framework. The framework was validated using covariance-based structural equation modelling. The model was validated using fit indices like discriminant validity, standardised root mean square (SRMR), comparative fit index (CFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), etc. Findings: The model revealed that an inclusive educational system, decentralised real estate market and data management system are the major drivers for applying data science techniques to real estate professionals. Also, real estate professionals' application of the drivers will guarantee an effective data analysis of real estate investments. Originality/value: Numerous studies have clamoured for adopting data science techniques for real estate professionals. There is a lack of studies on the drivers that will guarantee the successful adoption of data science techniques. A modern form of data analysis for real estate professionals was also proposed in the study. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business,

This paper describes an ""alternative midterm""experiment conducted in an undergraduate introductory data science class. In this pilot, students were asked to demonstrate their newly learned data science skills by teaching them to individuals without data science backgrounds. The evidence of learning will be illustrated through an in-depth analysis of the students' teaching products.

Given the centrality of computing and programming in the contemporary practice of DS, many of these courses include topics historically reserved for computer science (CS) classes. Further, many CS courses include dedicated time for DS topics (e.g., AP Computer Science Principles' unit on Data). In many ways, DS educators and CS educators are working towards the same ends in complementary ways. However, at other times, the two disciplines are in tension, especially given the scarcity of time in K-12 student schedules for non-core subjects.

In introductory data science courses, however, students have found these transformations particularly challenging to learn. One complex transformation is the pivot transformation, which reorganizes a table based on aggregation and summarizing along selected columns and rows. Current assessments test student understanding in static scenarios. Thus, there is an opportunity to help students explicitly work through the steps and variables needed to express a pivot transformation in a randomizable manner. As such, we explore whether a dynamic digital assessment for the pivot transformation can effectively achieve mastery learning towards this skill. Our design is inspired by Parsons problems, in which answer components (pivot table output labels and values) can be composed into the output of a pivot transformation. A question can be derived from a small randomized dataset, and randomized Pandas code that operates upon the dataset and can be autograded. We plan to conduct a pilot study with data science students to investigate whether 1) using a programmable online platform to practice pivot tables helps improve performance on exams, and 2) randomization and instant feedback on the online platform contribute to improved student learning. © 2024 Owner/Author.",Computer Science,

Addressing this gap, we adopted a student-centric approach to craft a disability fairness teaching intervention. A focus group of students experienced in ML and accessible computing underscored the significance of engagement and scaffolding strategies for effectively learning intricate topics. Consequently, we crafted a disability fairness hands-on programming assignment that delves into uncovering disability bias with a lens that takes intersectionality into account.

To better understand learners' needs and pain points when they are introduced to DS programming, we investigated a large online course on data manipulation designed for graduate students who do not have a CS or Statistics undergraduate degree. We qualitatively analyzed students' incorrect code submissions for computational notebook-based assignments in Python. We identified common mistakes and grouped them into the following themes: (1) programming language and environment misconceptions, (2) logical mistakes due to data or problem-statement misunderstanding or incorrectly dealing with missing values, (3) semantic mistakes due to incorrect use of DS libraries, and (4) suboptimal coding.

Thus, this study aims to use data science models to understand and predict career satisfaction based on information collected from surveys of university alumni. Five machine learning (ML) algorithms were used for data analysis, including the decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machine, and neural network models. To achieve optimal prediction performance, we utilized the Bayesian optimization method to fine-tune the parameters of the five ML algorithms. The five ML models were compared with logistic and ordinal regression. Then, to extract the most important features of the best predictive model, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a novel methodology for extracting the significant features in ML. The results indicated that gradient boosting is a marginally superior predictive model, with 2–3% higher accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) compared to logistic and ordinal regression. Interestingly, concerning low career satisfaction, those with the worst scores for the phrase “how frequently applied knowledge, skills, or technological tools from the academic training” were less satisfied with their careers. To summarize, career satisfaction is related to academic training, alumni satisfaction, employment status, published articles or books, and other factors. © 2024 by the authors.",Computer Science,

This research investigates the critical issue of packet loss in modern wireless networks and aims to identify the conditions within a network’s environment that lead to such losses. We propose a packet status prediction model for data packets that travel through a wireless network based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and are exposed to five different types of interference in a controlled experimentation environment. The proposed model focuses on the packetization process and its impact on network robustness. This study explores the challenges posed by packet loss, particularly in the context of interference, and puts forth the hypothesis that specific environmental conditions are linked to packet loss occurrences. The contribution of this work lies in advancing our understanding of the conditions leading to packet loss in wireless networks. Data are retrieved with a single CC2531 USB Dongle Packet Sniffer, whose pieces of information on packets become the features of each packet from which the classifier model will gather the training data with the aim of predicting whether a packet will unsuccessfully arrive at its destination. We found that interference causes more packet loss than that caused by various devices using a WiFi communication protocol simultaneously. In addition, we found that the most important predictors are network strength and packet size; low network strength tends to lead to more packet loss, especially for larger packets. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts to predict and mitigate packet loss, emphasizing the need for adaptive models in dynamic wireless environments. © 2024 by the authors.",Engineering,

Systematic prioritization of drug targets using bioinformatics and database-driven decision-making can provide a competitive advantage in therapeutic R&D. This study investigated the evidence on the druggability of these aldosterone targets in heart failure. Methods: The target disease predictability of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and aldosterone synthase (AS) in cardiac failure was evaluated using Open Targets target-disease association scores. The Open Targets database collections were downloaded to MongoDB and queried according to the desired aggregation level, and the results were retrieved from the Europe PMC (data type: text mining), ChEMBL (data type: drugs), Open Targets Genetics Portal (data type: genetic associations), and IMPC (data type: genetic associations) databases. The target tractability of MR and AS in the cardiovascular system was investigated by computing activity scores in a curated ChEMBL database using supervised machine learning. Results: The medians of the association scores of the MR and AS groups were similar, indicating a comparable predictability of the target disease. The median of the MR activity scores group was significantly lower than that of AS, indicating that AS has higher target tractability than MR [Hodges-Lehmann difference 0.62 (95%CI 0.53–0.70, p < 0.0001]. The cumulative distributions of the overall multiplatform association scores of cardiac diseases with MR were considerably higher than with AS, indicating more advanced investigations on a wider range of disorders evaluated for MR (Kolmogorov-Smirnov D = 0.36, p = 0.0009). In curated ChEMBL, MR had a higher cumulative distribution of activity scores in experimental cardiovascular assays than AS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov D = 0.23, p < 0.0001). Documented clinical trials for MR in heart failures surfaced in database searches, none for AS. Conclusions: Although its clinical development has lagged behind that of MR, our findings indicate that AS is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac failure. The multiplatform-integrated identification used in this study allowed us to comprehensively explore the available scientific evidence on MR and AS for heart failure therapy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Medicine,

With the lack of predictability in medication effectiveness from patient to patient, acquiring the specifics of their genotype would be highly advantageous for patient treatment. Genotype-guided dosing adjustment improves clinical decision-making and helps optimize doses to deliver medications with greater efficacy and within safe margins. Current databases demand extensive effort to locate relevant genetic dosing information. To address this problem, Patient Optimization Pharmacogenomics (POPGx) was constructed. The objective of this paper is to describe the development of POPGx, a tool to simplify the approach for healthcare providers to determine pharmacogenomic dosing recommendations for patients taking multiple medications. Additionally, this tool educates patients on how their allele variations may impact gene function in case they need further healthcare consultations. POPGx was created on Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME). KNIME is a modular environment that allows users to conduct code-free data analysis. The POPGx workflow can access Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines and subsequently be able to present relevant dosing and counseling information. A KNIME representational state transfer (REST) application program interface (API) node was established to retrieve information from CPIC and drugs that are exclusively metabolized through CYP450, and these drugs were processed simultaneously to demonstrate competency of the workflow. The POPGx program provides a time-efficient method for users to retrieve relevant, patient-specific medication selection and dosing recommendations. Users input metabolizer gene, genetic allele data, and medication list to retrieve clear dosing information. The program is automated to display current guideline recommendations from CPIC. The integration of this program into healthcare systems has the potential to revolutionize patient care by giving healthcare practitioners an easy way to prescribe medications with greater efficacy and safety by utilizing the latest advancements in the field of pharmacogenomics.

Furthermore, this pivot had to be accomplished in the virtual environment given the nation-wide lockdown. Methods These needs and context led to leveraging of the San Francisco Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (SF BUILD) theories of change to innovate a Virtual BUILD Research Collaboratory (VBRC). The purpose of VBRC was to train Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) students to apply their unique perspectives to biomedical research. These training activities were evaluated using a pre-post survey design that included both validated and new psychosocial scales. A new scale was piloted to measure culturally relevant pedagogy. Results VBRC scholars increased science identity on two items: thinking of myself as a scientist (+1point, p = 0.006) and belonging to a community of scientists (+1point, p = 0.069). Overall, scholars perceived stress also decreased over VBRC (-2.35 points, p = 0.02). Post VBRC, scholars had high agency scores (μ = 11.02, Md = 12, range = 6–12, σ = 1.62) and cultural humility scores (μ = 22.11, Md = 23, range = 12–24, σ = 2.71). No notable race/ethnic differences were found in any measures. Conclusions Taken together, our innovative approach to data science training for BIPOC in unprecedented times shows promise for better preparing the workforce critically needed to address the fundamental gaps in knowledge at the intersection of public health, structural racism, and biomedical sciences. © 2024 Ceberio et al.

However, there is still a lack of clarity regarding the specific skills of data scientists. This study addresses this issue by employing Correlated Topic Modeling (CTM) to analyse the content of 41 master programs offered by 11 Dutch universities and an interuniversity combined program. We assess the differences and similarities in the core skills taught by these programs, determine the subject-specific and general nature of the skills, and provide a comparison between the different types of universities offering these programs. Our analysis reveals that data processing, statistics, research, and ethics are the core competencies in Dutch data science and AI master programs. General universities tend to focus on research skills, while technical universities lean more towards IT and electronics skills. Broad-focussed data science and AI programs generally concentrate on data processing, information technology, electronics, and research, while subject-specific programs give priority to statistics and ethics.

It is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia and presents with severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses have provided some insight into disease pathology. Variants within SNCA, GBA, APOE, SNCB, and MAPT have been shown to be associated with DLB in repeated genomic studies. Transcriptomic analysis, conducted predominantly on candidate genes, has identified signatures of synuclein aggregation, protein degradation, amyloid deposition, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the upregulation of heat-shock proteins in DLB. Yet, the understanding of DLB molecular pathology is incomplete. This precipitates the current clinical position whereby there are no available disease-modifying treatments or blood-based diagnostic biomarkers. Data science methods have the potential to improve disease understanding, optimising therapeutic intervention and drug development, to reduce disease burden. Genomic prediction will facilitate the early identification of cases and the timely application of future disease-modifying treatments. Transcript-level analyses across the entire transcriptome and machine learning analysis of multi-omic data will uncover novel signatures that may provide clues to DLB pathology and improve drug development.

We examine whether and to what extent infrastructure development as measured from the satellite images as well as spatial spillovers helps predict the poverty rate of a given census tract. We also develop and implement a Vector Autoregression (VAR) based ensemble model that combines predictions from daytime and nighttime imaging with adjacent tracts' poverty rates and other economic and demographic factors identified in prior literature. Our results show that daytime imaging and spatial network features have significant predictive value and that a combination of these features gives the best predictive power. In addition, we find that the skewness of poverty rates among adjacent census tracts, not the average, is a significant predictor showing the importance of distribution of poverty around a region.

We studied how participants in an initiative to establish data science at a large American research university defined data science and articulated their relationships to the field. We discuss two contrasting visions for data science among our research participants. One vision is a transdisciplinary view portraying data science as a phenomenon with transcendent, appropriative, and impositional qualities that sits apart from academic domains. Another view of data science—one that was far more prevalent among our research subjects—casts data science as grounded, relational, and adaptive, emerging from crosspollination of numerous academic domains. We argue that this latter formulation represents a more quotidian reality of data science and positions the field as an extradiscipline, defined as a field that exists to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, skills, tools, and methods from an indeterminate and fluctuating set of disciplinary perspectives while conserving the boundaries of those disciplines. We argue that the dueling transdisciplinary and extradisciplinary visions for data science have important implications for how the field will mature, and that the extradiscipline concept opens novel directions for studying academic knowledge production in STS, contributing additional precision to the literature on disciplinarity and its permutations. © The Author(s) 2023.",Social Sciences,

We then show how software development environments can be repurposed to infrastructure reflexivities and to make co-laborative engagement with AI-related technology possible and productive. We document our own co-laborative engagement with machine learning and highlight three exemplary critical technical practices that emerged out of the co-laboration: negotiating comparabilities, shifting contextual attention and challenging similarity and difference.

With the increasing complexity of microstructures and mechanical properties of materials, it has become extremely difficult to develop more complex phenomenological constitutive models. Non-universal material models, which are difficult to relate to material properties and manufacturing processes, have become one of the main problems limiting plastic forming and processing, and also pose a serious challenge to the development of plasticity theory. The development of artificial intelligence and data science opened up new possibilities in materials and mechanical sciences. With the rapid development of material design and application, the traditional explicit constitutive model is not needed, the theoretical modelling approaches to plastic deformation that reflect the relationship between the microstructures and macroscopic properties of materials come into being. Among them, the new paradigm modelling theories represented by mechanistically informed neural networks, efficient multi-scale clustering analysis and model-free data-driven computational mechanics have their distinctive features and significant advantages, which are the most promising simulation methods.

A dirhodium(II)-catalyzed C-H insertion of donor/donor carbenes into 2-alkoxybenzophenone substrates to form benzodihydrofurans was selected as a model system to explore nonlinear methods to achieve a mechanistic understanding. We found that the application of traditional methods of multivariate linear regression (MLR) correlating DFT-derived descriptors of catalysts and substrates leads to poorly performing models. This inspired the introduction of nonlinear descriptor relationships into modeling by applying the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) algorithm. Based on SISSO-generated descriptors, a high-performing MLR model was identified that predicts external validation points well. Mechanistic interpretation was aided by the deconstruction of feature relationships using chemical space maps, decision trees, and linear descriptors. Substrates were found to have a strong dependence on steric effects for determining their innate cyclization selectivity preferences. Catalyst reactive site features can then be matched to product features to tune or override the resultant diastereoselectivity within the substrate-dictated ranges.

This study explores the differential impacts of formative and binary feedback on learner performance within a data-driven MOOC environment. Over 4,000 participants in a four-week data science program were divided into two groups. One group received formative feedback, offering detailed insights and guidance, while the other group received binary feedback, indicating only right or wrong answers. Our analysis focused on three programming exercises of increasing complexity, assessing how each type of feedback influenced the learners' performance. Results indicate minimal differences in performance between the two feedback groups, suggesting that the type of feedback may not significantly impact learner outcomes in environments where participants are already actively engaged and the tasks are not overly challenging. The findings challenge the assumption that more detailed feed-back universally enhances learning, highlighting the importance of aligning feedback strategies with learner proficiency and task difficulty. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse in programming education by suggesting that MOOC providers might optimize resource allocation by tailoring feedback mechanisms to the specific needs of the learner population, thereby enhancing both educational efficiency and effectiveness. © 2024 IEEE.",Computer Science,

The app captures a user’s movements through the built-in camera of a mobile device and processes the images for data generation using BlazePose, an open-source computer vision model for real-time pose estimation. Students can be entirely involved in the data collection process through the app. Consequently, the motion data is contextually rich and holds personal relevance for them. This connection allows students to establish a direct relationship between their body movements and the corresponding motion data, facilitating a deeper understanding of the data. The app then takes advantage of this motion data as a data source to demonstrate various concepts and techniques in data science. As examples of the proposed learning framework, we introduce two learning modules, one focused on principal component analysis and the other on k-means clustering. To reduce learning demands, the app also provides various visual aids, such as interactive graphs and figures, that simplify the learning by visualizing the geometric interpretation of the motion data. Strategies to encompass other data science methods are also discussed for further improvement. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2024.",Social Sciences,

In this paper, we use a broad definition of data science to outline three foundational aspects that could be addressed during the schooling years: (1) reasoning with data; (2) computational thinking; and (3) inquiry-based learning. Drawing on video data and artefacts from a primary classroom in Australia (children aged 9–10 years old), we examined how a class generated and grappled with a complex, ambiguous problem about the risks and benefits of their activities in cyberspace. The interdisciplinary lesson sequence engaged the children with non-standard data, data privacy, and ethical issues in age-appropriate ways. The analysis used an iterative process that annotated video logs, identified and transcribed critical events linked to these three foundational aspects, and coded these data to make connections within and across the data. The findings suggest a process for introducing children to age-appropriate problems that can be addressed by data science that reflect contexts in their world. Implications of the study provide teachers, researchers, and curriculum developers suggestions for embedding data science education into primary school. © Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc. 2024.",Social Sciences,

Some of the existing studies on the stuck pipe detection have adopted supervised machine learning approaches that employ datasets for “stuck” and “normal”. However, for early detection before the occurrence of stuck pipe, the application of ordinal binary classification in supervised machine learning has presented several elemental concerns, such as limited stuck pipe data, and lack of an exact “stuck sign” before occurrence. Our previous studies proposed unsupervised machine learning approaches using data on the normal activities with long short-term memories and autoencoder, the mixture probability model, and graph attention model, and presented the possibility of predicting a stuck pipe. On the other hand, there observed false positives responding the operation of drilling equipment or changes in drilling data. We introduce a data science approach, including machine learning, incorporating physical knowledge to overcome frequent false positives. This study initially introduces the stuck pipe predictions using unsupervised machine learning approaches, and a typical false positive case. Subsequently, we present machine learning integrating physical knowledge and demonstrate early stuck pipe detection using field data containing stuck pipe events. The results show significant suppression of false positives. Our machine learning approach is expected to contribute to considerable reduction of nonproductive time in drilling operations, potentially preventing well abandonment.

The results of the model selection criteria depict that the ELM algorithm is adequate for France, Germany, and Spain, while the MLP algorithm tends to have a better forecast for India and Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, Italy, and the United States, the well-known ARIMAX model tends to be a good match for death predictions. The findings showed that the inclusion of the meteorological variables improves the accuracy of modeling both COVID-19 cases and deaths, for all the chosen countries’ cumulative confirmed cases except Italy and Sri Lanka. However, in the case of modeling deaths, it is observed that the inclusion of meteorological variables was not able to enhance the forecasting accuracy of the model in each of the selected countries. Though no single model was found to be suitable for all countries, the authors identify the most appropriate models for each country for forecasting and make the sixty-day-ahead forecast for each country. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Mathematics,

For instance, a set of logins recorded for a regular period of each user. Similarly, time series data refers to a set of values arranged in the form of stock prices, sensor data, application telemetry, and click stream data. Anomaly is an unusual activity which is different from normal behavior. There are different methods adopted to find anomalies and trends in time series data in data science. Irrespective of technological advances in anomaly detection and system monitoring, there is still the risk of false positives. There are several anomaly detection models - some are generic while some are domain-specific. However, there is still a lack of a sufficient algorithm that can work with various datasets. Hence, this study will discuss various types of anomalies and components of time series data. This study will also propose a framework based on machine learning methods for detecting anomalies and selecting appropriate models for time series data analysis. This study will also present a taxonomy to define several aspects of 'anomaly detection in time-series data. Performing anomaly detection regarding the context or types of activities a system is exposed to is one of the major challenges in existing techniques for anomaly detection. This study will help researchers to understand the emerging approaches of 'time series anomaly detection' and computational methods. © 2024 IEEE.",Computer Science,

However, accessing and collecting patient-level SDOH data can be operationally challenging in the emergency department (ED) clinical setting, requiring innovative approaches. Objective: This scoping review examines the potential of AI and data science for modeling, extraction, and incorporation of SDOH data specifically within EDs, further identifying areas for advancement and investigation. Methods: We conducted a standardized search for studies published between 2015 and 2022, across Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Web of Science, and ERIC databases. We focused on identifying studies using AI or data science related to SDOH within emergency care contexts or conditions. Two specialized reviewers in emergency medicine (EM) and clinical informatics independently assessed each article, resolving discrepancies through iterative reviews and discussion. We then extracted data covering study details, methodologies, patient demographics, care settings, and principal outcomes. Results: Of the 1047 studies screened, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Notably, 9 out of 26 (35%) studies were solely concentrated on ED patients. Conditions studied spanned broad EM complaints and included sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, and asthma. The majority of studies (n=16) explored multiple SDOH domains, with homelessness/housing insecurity and neighborhood/built environment predominating. Machine learning (ML) techniques were used in 23 of 26 studies, with natural language processing (NLP) being the most commonly used approach (n=11). Rule-based NLP (n=5), deep learning (n=2), and pattern matching (n=4) were the most commonly used NLP techniques. NLP models in the reviewed studies displayed significant predictive performance with outcomes, with F1-scores ranging between 0.40 and 0.75 and specificities nearing 95.9%. Conclusions: Although in its infancy, the convergence of AI and data science techniques, especially ML and NLP, with SDOH in EM offers transformative possibilities for better usage and integration of social data into clinical care and research. With a significant focus on the ED and notable NLP model performance, there is an imperative to standardize SDOH data collection, refine algorithms for diverse patient groups, and champion interdisciplinary synergies. These efforts aim to harness SDOH data optimally, enhancing patient care and mitigating health disparities. Our research underscores the vital need for continued investigation in this domain. © Ethan E Abbott, Donald Apakama, Lynne D Richardson, Lili Chan, Girish N Nadkarni.",Medicine,

The latest developments call for human-centric, iterative, continuous, and perhaps transparent planning actions to evaluate and align AI systems considering the interconnected data-related, political, technological, and societal viewpoints beyond the organizational level with the participation of multiple for-profit and nonprofit organizations or governments. The emerging data science roadmapping (DSR), developed by customizing technology roadmapping, can enable such initiatives because it provides a human-centric and agile platform incorporating data layers as strategic planning elements considering the data science life cycle. However, the technology management literature must exemplify its adaptations beyond the organizational level in more diverse planning scenarios for data and AI professionals to plan well-coordinated operations at the industrial and governmental divisions by considering the interconnected technological, political, and sociological perspectives.

In this paper, we present a data science solution that integrates weather data with historical energy consumption data for energy consumption analysis. Consequently, the solution predicts temporal energy consumption patterns via techniques like frequent pattern mining, traditional machine learning, and deep learning. Our solution integrates meteorological and environmental conditions over time series, analyzes them, forecasts energy consumption, and examines how weather conditions affect energy usage variation. Evaluation results on a real-world dataset show that our solution identifies several distinct frequent patterns with frequent pattern mining, and it reveals a significant relationship between irradiance and energy consumption, as well as a positive correlation between temperature and energy usage. Moreover, our solution predicts and compares energy consumption for a specific year using linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting models with daily weather data. Additionally, we applied a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to analyze energy consumption as time-series data, uncovering patterns based on given time steps. These results demonstrate the practicality of our data science solution for energy consumption analysis. © 2024 IEEE.",Computer Science,

The purpose is to predict ""m"" with limited measurements by machine learning models trained with core data and special logs from key wells. Different authors have addressed the ranges of ""m"" based on the type of porosity or rock texture; however, most of these studies are not from Mexican fields. Information was compiled from 1,154 data points obtained from cores in different porous systems, including matrix, fractures, unconnected vugs, and connected vugs. Probabilistic and statistical theorems were used to handle complex and nonlinear relationships between porosity and the cementation exponent ""m"". Data science revealed patterns that were not evident or were influenced by multiple factors. Finally, test examples of partitioned porosity data and several measured cementation exponent core well data have been provided to verify the effectiveness and adaptability for the determination of the cementation exponent ""m"" through the so-called SPP (Statistical Porosity Partitioning) method. This also provides algorithm support for different porous systems (matrix, fractures and vugs), achieving a MAAPE (Mean Arctangent Absolute Percentage Error) of 0.22 between the originals and the predicted values. The first example applying the SPP method is through the development of an equation to analyze a triple-porosity NFR (intergranular, vugs and fractures), successfully predicting the porosity exponent, with an accuracy of around 70% compared to the core-measured data. The second example demonstrates the success of the equation's performance in a dual-porosity NFR (matrix-fractures). Next, the third example was conducted in a well with connected vugs and matrix, achieving a 100% prediction accuracy of the cementation exponent ""m"" value compared to the core-measured data. Finally, the fourth case shows an example of an exploratory well without any core analysis, and the results of applying our model achieved a better understanding of the reservoir behavior. The input features for cementation exponent identification are effective porosity and discrete porous system log, with resulting values of 1, 2, 3, and 4, depending on the type of NFR present. The SPP method was then applied to wells lacking specific core information to obtain a cementation exponent ""m"" exclusively for naturally fractured reservoirs (NFR), thus reducing uncertainty in estimation of hydrocarbon reserves.

Thanks to high-performance computing, sophisticated graphics processing units, and advanced analytics, we are now on the cusp of being able to use these data to significantly improve individualized care for people with epilepsy. Despite this, many clinicians, health care providers, and people with epilepsy are apprehensive about implementing Big Data and accompanying technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Practical, ethical, privacy, and climate issues represent real and enduring concerns that have yet to be completely resolved. Similarly, Big Data and AI-related biases have the potential to exacerbate local and global disparities. These are highly germane concerns to the field of epilepsy, given its high burden in developing nations and areas of socioeconomic deprivation. This educational paper from the International League Against Epilepsy's (ILAE) Big Data Commission aims to help clinicians caring for people with epilepsy become familiar with how Big Data is collected and processed, how they are applied to studies using AI, and outline the immense potential positive impact Big Data can have on diagnosis and management. © 2024 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: The research method used analytical statistical methods to propose a classification model. The project science research concepts were integrated with the statistical process monitoring (SPM) concepts using the modeling methods applied in the data science (DS) area. For the integration development, SPM Phases I and II were associated, generating models with a structured data analysis process, creating a continuous validation approach. Findings: Validation was performed by simulation and analytical techniques applied to the Cohen’s Kappa index, supported by voluntary comparisons in the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and the Youden index, generating prescriptive criteria for the classification. Kappa-based control charts performed well for m = 5 sample amounts and n = 500 sizes when Pe is less than 0.8. The simulations also showed that Kappa control requires fewer samples than the other indices studied. Originality/value: The main contributions of this study to both theory and practitioners is summarized as follows: (1) it proposes DS and SPM integration; (2) it develops a tool for continuous predictive classification models validation; (3) it compares different indices for model quality, indicating their advantages and disadvantages; (4) it defines sampling criteria and procedure for SPM application considering the technique’s Phases I and II and (5) the validated approach serves as a basis for various analyses, enabling an objective comparison among all alternative designs. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business,

Our system fills in important gaps in existing diagnostic methods, which are brought about by the rising prevalence of phobic disorders and the need for tailored therapeutic approaches. Our suggested system's complex algorithm is based on machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. By processing EEG data, these models allow for precise and effective phobia detection, severity categorization, and therapeutic intervention. With robust performance and accuracy rates of 96.44% for Support Vector Classifier, 98.24% for Random Forest Classifier, 98.59% for Extreme Gradient Boosting, and 96.48% for Logistic Regression, our algorithm has been trained on a variety of datasets.

Multicenter observational research could address many of those concerns, especially in hand surgery where multicenter research is currently quite limited; however, there are numerous barriers including regulatory issues, lack of common terminology, and variable data set structures. The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) program aims to surmount these limitations by enabling large-scale, collaborative research across multiple institutions. The OHDSI uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to standardize health care data into a common language, enabling consistent and reliable analysis. The OMOP CDM has been transformative in converting multiple databases into a standardized code with a single vocabulary, allowing for coherent analysis across multiple data sets. Building upon the OMOP CDM, OHDSI provides an extensive suite of open-source tools for all research stages, from data extraction to statistical modeling. By keeping sensitive data local and only sharing summary statistics, OHDSI ensures compliance with privacy regulations while allowing for large-scale analyses. For hand surgery, OHDSI can enhance research depth, understanding of outcomes, risk factors, complications, and device performance, ultimately leading to better patient care. © 2024 American Society for Surgery of the Hand",Medicine,

A key challenge associated with this condition is achieving an early diagnosis. The current study seeks to anticipate and delineate the assessments offered by both parents and teachers concerning a child’s behavior and overall functioning with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-2 (BRIEF-2). Mothers, fathers, and teachers of 59 children diagnosed or in the process of being assessed for ADHD participated in this study. The responses provided by 59 mothers, 59 fathers, and 57 teachers to the BRIEF-2 questionnaire were collected. The performance of various feature selection techniques, including Lasso, decision trees, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and forward stepwise regression, was evaluated. The results indicate that Lasso stands out as the optimal method for our dataset, striking an ideal balance between accuracy and interpretability. A repeated validation analysis reveals an average positive correlation exceeding 0.5 between the inattention/hyperactivity scores reported by informants (mother, father, or teacher) and the predictions derived from Lasso. This performance is achieved using only approximately 18% of the BRIEF-2 items. These findings underscore the usefulness of variable selection techniques in accurately characterizing a patient’s condition while employing a small subset of assessment items. This efficiency is particularly valuable in time-constrained settings and contributes to improving the comprehension of ADHD. © 2024 the author(s),",Neuroscience,

However, these skills are not routinely taught, representing a growing unmet educational need. This education report presents a structured short course that was run to teach clinicians data science and the lessons learnt. Methods: A 1-day introductory course was conducted within a tertiary hospital in London. It consisted of lectures followed by facilitated pair programming exercises in R, an object-oriented programming language. Feedback was collated and participant responses were graded using a Likert scale. Results: The course was attended by 20 participants. The majority of participants (69%) were in higher speciality cardiology training. While more than half of the participants (56%) received prior training in statistics either through formal taught programmes (e.g., a Master’s degree) or online courses, the participants reported several barriers to expanding their skills in data science due to limited programming skills, lack of dedicated time, training opportunities and awareness. After the short course, there was a significant increase in participants’ self-rated confidence in using R for data analysis (mean response; before the course: 1.69 ± 1.0, after the course: 3.2 ± 0.9, p =.0005) and awareness of the capabilities of R (mean response; before the course: 2.1 ± 0.9, after the course: 3.6 ± 0.7, p =.0001, on a 5-point Likert scale).

Patterns influencing health outcomes and disease in the environment are complex and require an understanding of the ecology of the disease and how these interact in space and time. Knowing where and when diseases are prevalent, who is affected and what may be driving these outcomes is important for determining how to respond. In reality, we all would like to be healthy and live in healthy places. In this book, epidemiology and public health are integrated with spatial data science to examine health issues in dynamically changing environments. This is too broad a field to be completely covered in one book, and so, it has been necessary to be selective with the topics, methods and examples used to avoid overwhelming introductory readers while at the same time providing sufficient depth for geospatial experts interested in health and for health professionals interested in integrating geospatial elements for health analysis. A variety of geographic information (some novel, some volunteered, some authoritative, some big and messy) is used with a mix of methods consisting of spatial analysis, data science and spatial statistics to better understand health risks and disease outcomes. Key Features: Makes spatial data science accessible to health Integrates epidemiology and disease ecology with spatial data science Integrates theoretical geographic information science concepts Provides practical and applied approaches for examining and exploring health and disease risks Provides spatial data science skill development ranging from map making to spatial modelling. © 2025 Justine Blanford.",Computer Science,

In particular, we demonstrate their use in computing probabilities associated with various events (winning matches, advancing rounds, and becoming champions) of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. Building on Dixon and Cole’s 1997 seminal model, we develop a competing Poisson model that incorporates for each participating team its attack and defense strengths as well as home-advantage effects. The calibration of the model considers match importance levels and emphasizes the recency of a team’s performance. Evaluations of the model’s results on various prediction accuracy and error metrics indicate that its performance equals or betters the traditional Poisson model and is similar to established betting sites. Our website featuring the model received over 30,000 visits from 11,000 users across 10 countries during the 2022 World Cup and garnered significant media coverage in Argentina.

Objective: We conducted a systematic review to identify learning preferences and strategies in the HDS discipline. Methods: We searched 10 bibliographic databases (PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Wiley Online Library, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, EBSCOhost, ERIC, and IEEE Xplore) from the date of inception until June 2023. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and included primary studies written in English that investigated the learning preferences or strategies of students in HDS-related disciplines, such as bioinformatics, at any academic level. Risk of bias was independently assessed by 2 screeners using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, and we used narrative data synthesis to present the study results. Results: After abstract screening and full-text reviewing of the 849 papers retrieved from the databases, 8 (0.9%) studies, published between 2009 and 2021, were selected for narrative synthesis. The majority of these papers (7/8, 88%) investigated learning preferences, while only 1 (12%) paper studied learning strategies in HDS courses. The systematic review revealed that most HDS learners prefer visual presentations as their primary learning input. In terms of learning process and organization, they mostly tend to follow logical, linear, and sequential steps. Moreover, they focus more on abstract information, rather than detailed and concrete information. Regarding collaboration, HDS students sometimes prefer teamwork, and sometimes they prefer to work alone. Conclusions: The studies’ quality, assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, ranged between 73% and 100%, indicating excellent quality overall. However, the number of studies in this area is small, and the results of all studies are based on self-reported data. Therefore, more research needs to be conducted to provide insight into HDS education. We provide some suggestions, such as using learning analytics and educational data mining methods, for conducting future research to address gaps in the literature. We also discuss implications for HDS educators, and we make recommendations for HDS course design; for example, we recommend including visual materials, such as diagrams and videos, and offering step-by-step instructions for students. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

Despite extensive discourse within statistical communities on confronting these emerging challenges, we offer our unique perspectives, underscoring the extended responsibilities of statisticians in pre-analysis and post-analysis tasks. Moreover, we propose a new definition and classification of Big Data based on data sources: Type I Big Data, which is the result of aggregating a large number of small datasets via data sharing and curation, and Type II Big Data, which is the Real-World Data (RWD) amassed from business operations and practices. Each category necessitates distinct data preprocessing and preparation (DPP) methods, and the objectives of analysis as well as the interpretation of results can significantly diverge between these two types of Big Data. We further suggest that the statistical communities should consider adopting and rapidly incorporating new paradigms and cultures by learning from other disciplines. Particularly, beyond Breiman’s (Stat Sci 16(3):199–231, 2021) two modeling cultures, statisticians may need to pay more attention to a newly emerging third culture: the integration of algorithmic modeling with multi-scale dynamic modeling based on fundamental physics laws or mechanisms that generate the data.

This involves streamlining processes such as production, logistics, pipeline monitoring, refinery operations, plant safety, and environmental impact reduction. Artificial intelligence involves developing intelligent systems that operate autonomously, learn from experiences, and improve performance with increasing knowledge. On the other hand, data science focuses on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data to drive valuable insights. In the midstream stage, which pertains to crude or refined petroleum transportation, digital twin technology plays a crucial role, offering applications like pipeline monitoring and logistics optimization. Downstream is the refinery, processing and purifying of crude oil and natural gas. Companies like Shell and Chevron leverage in real-time data from sensors, cameras, and drones to create dynamic representations of operations and equipment for real-time monitoring and analysis. However, maintaining accurate and up-to-date digital twin models poses challenges. This is where AI techniques like optimization (model creation and updating), generative modelling, data analytics, predictive analytics, and decision-making come to play.

The UAM vision is one in which advanced technologies and new operational procedures enable practical and cost-effective air transport as an integrated mode of movement of people and goods throughout metropolitan areas. To safely support UAM operations at scale in the National Airspace System (NAS), NASA’s Air Traffic Management-Exploration (ATM-X) project has been conducting research that evolves the UAM air traffic management system towards a highly automated and operationally flexible system of the future. The complexity of UAM airspace evolution to accommodate the increasing tempo of UAM operations over time is managed through the UAM airspace research roadmap, which is a system engineering approach to the R&D of complex system-of-systems, where system’s interdependencies make it nearly impossible to define requirements for individual elements of the system in isolation. These interdependencies form a knowledge graph (node-link network) with a highly complex structure far beyond the human user’s ability to extract insights for project management’s research portfolio assessment. This study applies advanced data analytics in knowledge graph to the UAM knowledge graph to facilitate the portfolio assessment. © 2024, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Data Science (DS) aims to extract knowledge from data and thus, has gained attraction from organizations aiming to optimize existing processes and uncover previously unknown potentials. DS can be beneficially integrated into the business processes of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Therefore, in this study, a structured literature review is conducted to assess the current state-of-the-art of DS in OEMs, especially in the automotive industry and in procurement, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in DS and OEMs. Several financial, operative, and strategic potentials of DS in the context of OEMs are identified and described. Examples are operational cost reduction, supplier selection and evaluation, forecasts of product demand, and promoted collaboration between stakeholders. Nevertheless, the literature also suggests several challenges in the execution of DS projects. It was observed that OEMs face both technological and procedural obstacles in this area, including the lack of data-driven work culture, inappropriate systems, and deficits with data collection and integration. Mitigating these challenges will be valuable in improving the success rates of DS projects. Further measures to enrich the results of this article are provided.

While the roots of LLM can be traced back to the Markovian theories proposed in 1906, Generative AI is the outcome of advancements in transformer-based deep neural networks which extend the machine learning paradigm. Fundamentally, there is a definitive need to store, manage, and use data to generate data that matches consumer needs. Generative AI-based tools today free users from the need to master programming language. This has paved the way for easy access to data generation, analytics, and subsequent dissemination of findings as per the consumer’s needs, often with or without a subscription fee. The ethical frameworks of AI are built on the four key principles, namely, beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice. In recent years, explicability, which incorporates intelligibility and accountability, was added as the fifth crucial principle in the framework. The use of AI by organizations have also led to reputational, regulatory, and legal risks, resulting in widespread discussions on Ethical AI or the ethical use of AI. In India, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR, India) has released guidelines for the Ethical Use of AI in Healthcare. Protecting data privacy at the individual (or citizen) level has been one of the crucial challenges in the healthcare sector. With the advent of Generative AI, these challenges have also experienced a multiplicative effect. In addition, the post-COVID-19 era has led to increased use of digital health technologies, fueling data privacy and security risks apart from misinformation (leading to infodemics) and bias. Such concerns often affect developing countries, especially in the healthcare sector. The present research provides a state-of-the-art review of the ethical frameworks for Generative AI in healthcare. The study also provides an overview of privacy-preserving Generative AI paradigms, enabling the policy-makers (government, private, and other not-for-profit entities) to plan, propose, and disseminate policies that preserve the privacy of the data shared at an individual level. The study will benefit researchers by developing methodologies that align with the ethical framework for Generative AI, thus aligning with the principles of using AI for Good. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Mathematics,

More precisely, we demonstrate that the training of self-organizing maps is an approximation to the training of Gaussian Mixture Models by gradient descent. As a consequence, the scores of a trained SOM can be treated as log-likelihoods of a GMM with tied, spherical covariance and used, e.g., for outlier detection, whereas sampling from trained SOMs is not well-defined. Furthermore, we outline how SGD-trained GMMs can be generalized to diagonal and more expressive covariance matrices and how this benefits typical data science applications such as outlier detection, sampling and generative classification.

Advanced tools for modeling and forecasting not only the physical indicators of this problem, but also the social, economic, and biological-evolutionary ones are necessary to reduce risks and gain control over the situation. This paper focuses on the social factors of climate change and their modeling and assessment since it is the involvement of society that is crucial in the implementation and enforcement of relevant initiatives, policies, and legislation. A review of methods and tools for such modeling and forecasting will allow us to analyze their evolution and identify the most effective ones in terms of accuracy and resource use. Particular attention is paid to the topic of multimodal data fusion because the problem of climate change in many aspects, including social, is multidimensional and caused by the cumulative effect of many factors.

This mobility and transport data can fuel data-driven services, ushering in a new era of possibilities. To facilitate the development of these digitalized mobility services, we propose a novel conceptual framework for Mobility Data Science. Our approach seamlessly merges two distinct research domains: 1) mobility and transport science, and 2) data science. Mobility Data Science serves as a connective tissue, bridging the digital layers of physical mobility and transport artefacts such as people, goods, transport means, and infrastructure with the digital layer of data-driven services. In this paper, we introduce our conceptual framework, shaped by insights from domain experts deeply immersed in the mobility and transport ecosystem. We present a practical application of our framework in guiding the implementation of a driving style detection service, demonstrating its effectiveness in translating theoretical concepts into real-world solutions. Furthermore, we validate our framework's versatility by applying it to various real-world cases from the scientific literature. Our demonstration showcases the framework's adaptability and its potential to unlock value by harnessing mobility and transport data, enabling the creation of impactful data-driven services.

In the field of large language models, we find there is no one-size-fits-all model which satisfies the needs of other scientists. There are differences in the soft results which may be a limitation on their application. To analyze these differences and lack of robustness, we propose a robust methodology that integrates classical statistical experimental design principles with the these advanced models, aiming to identify statistically significant differences among their outcomes. In particular, an experimental design is presented in which the main factors, levels, treatments and interactions that influence the predictions made by different models of complex natural language processing are identified. The main aim of this research is to better understand the influence of some controlled factors that are used in com-plex natural language processing models by applying classical statistical techniques, providing a comprehensive perspective on the relative effectiveness of different zero-shot classification models. It aims to offer practitioners insights into when and where certain models may be more or less sensitive, facilitating informed decision-making in applying these advanced language models.

The authors present problems of validity, reliability, and significance and provide common solutions based on statistical methodology to solve them. The book focuses on model-based empirical methods where data annotations and model predictions are treated as training data for interpretable probabilistic models from the well-understood families of generalized additive models (GAMs) and linear mixed effects models (LMEMs). Based on the interpretable parameters of the trained GAMs or LMEMs, the book presents model-based statistical tests such as a validity test that allows for the detection of circular features that circumvent learning. Furthermore, the book discusses a reliability coefficient using variance decomposition based on random effect parameters of LMEMs. Lastly, a significance test based on the likelihood ratios of nested LMEMs trained on the performance scores of two machine learning models is shown to naturally allow the inclusion of variations in meta-parameter settings into hypothesis testing, and further facilitates a refined system comparison conditional on properties of input data. The book is self-contained with an appendix on the mathematical background of generalized additive models and linear mixed effects models as well as an accompanying webpage with the related R and Python code to replicate the presented experiments. The second edition also features a new hands-on chapter that illustrates how to use the included tools in practical applications. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s).",Social Sciences,

Traditional statistical methods and machine learning algorithms usually fail to capture complicated patterns in these datasets. The paper fills that gap by proposing a novel deep learning-based method for mining biological data. The suggested method overcomes the constraints of existing systems by utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to extract hierarchical features and temporal correlations, respectively. Preprocessing techniques, supervised learning, transfer learning, and ensemble procedures are utilized to boost the system's accuracy (0.95), precision (0.94), recall (0.96), and F1score (0.95) when compared to other systems. The results indicate significant gains in accuracy across a variety of datasets, with the proposed system displaying computational efficiency, training in 8 hours and inference in 1 second, versus 15 hours and 5 seconds for conventional systems.

With the goal of recommending services to consumers that are highly relevant to their interests, this study primarily aims to facilitate service consumption for individual usage. In the future, when it comes to service composition, it will be possible to suggest services that connect certain points in a planned process with suitable services. In order to enhance the Web service discovery process, it is possible to conduct a thorough evaluation of Wikipedia's usefulness as a source of semantics. Service quality forecasting in a mobile computing context is complicated and requires attention. The cloud environment can easily accommodate the requested tasks. A cloud provider's implicit and explicit data may be used to find the right services for a company's processes. The relationships between services may also be deduced from the messages exchanged in the cloud. Last but not least, we present and implement a new architectural model for service selection systems that makes use of implicit feedbacks, suggests a CF-based service selection algorithm that takes into account user requirements during the ranking process, and employs the proposed Web service technique, support-based kernel, and enhanced vector-based ranking method. By taking into account the interests of all other users, the suggested model is able to solve the cold start issue for new users and new services. We proposed data science approach (WSDS) allows us to provide a tailored way for predicting the quality of service (QoS) of online services. We create a homomorphic hash-based user verification method and use the Byzantine agreement to weed out untrustworthy individuals. Next, we assess the suggested WSDS on a dataset of actual web services, and we use matrix factorization to improve prediction accuracy. The suggested strategy is much more successful than conventional procedures, according to the experimental findings. © 2024 IEEE.",Computer Science,

This expertise plays a crucial role in analyzing data sets of different sizes in various application contexts. Given the increasing demand for bringing these skills together in the work environment, which is characterized by an insufficient number of highly skilled individuals, smart solutions are being developed to strengthen these competencies. This study investigates the integration of data science competencies in the architecture of modern automation frameworks (AutoFM). In this way, it aims to encourage a discussion on the potential of these systems to facilitate the acquisition of data science skills by individuals, thus contributing to a broader discourse on workforce empowerment. For this purpose, a systematic literature search according to Webster and Watson was conducted to identify suitable automation frameworks corresponding to the data science competencies.

The results show that the AutoFMs theoretically cover characteristics of the required skills of a data scientist such as data visualization in some competence groups, but cannot cover the entire competence. Some skills can therefore be performed by AutoFMs in an interaction between humans and technology, while other skills are not yet supported. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Computer Science,

They assist data scientists in making proper conclusions, proving hypotheses, and making rational decisions. It is always preferable if analytical results can be obtained from multiple reliable sources. Thus, it is essential to assess such data sources in data sciences about various critical characteristics and factors. Nevertheless, the application of all-inclusive multi-attribute decision-making methodologies for the selection of data sources for integration has not received adequate attention in the existing literature and research. Thus, this article explains a new multi-attribute decision-making method through the model of the complex hesitant fuzzy rough set, which is the complex hesitant fuzzy rough multi-attribute decision-making method. This methodology would handle the evaluated values of attributes that have uncertainty, hesitancy, and roughness altogether. Besides, this study introduces several properties of complex hesitant fuzzy rough sets and develops several aggregation operators in the framework of complex hesitant fuzzy rough set and their properties. Subsequently, a case study of data source selection in data science is explained to explain the relevance of the developed multi-attribute decision-making framework in data sciences. Finally, the comparison of the devised theory with prevailing theories is interpreted. © 2013 IEEE.",Computer Science,

This study seeks to extend the power of pretraining methodologies to facilitating the prediction over tables in data science, a domain traditionally overlooked, yet inherently challenging due to the plethora of table schemas intrinsic to different tasks. The primary research questions underpinning this work revolve around the establishment of a universal pretraining protocol for tables with varied structures, the generalizability and transferability of learned knowledge across tasks, the adaptation to diverse downstream applications, and the incorporation of incremental columns over time. In response to these challenges, we introduce UniTabE, a straightforward yet effective method designed to process tables in a uniform manner, devoid of constraints imposed by specific table structures. UniTabE's core concept relies on representing each basic table element with a module, termed TabUnit. This is subsequently followed by a Transformer encoder to refine the representation. Moreover, our model is designed to facilitate pretraining and finetuning through the utilization of free-form prompts. In order to implement the pretraining phase, we curated an expansive tabular dataset comprising approximately 13 billion samples, meticulously gathered from the Kaggle platform. This research primarily centers on classification and regression tasks involving tabular data, and conducts rigorous experimental testing and analyses to validate the effectiveness of our methodology. The experimental results demonstrate UniTabE's superior performance against several baseline models across a multitude of benchmark datasets.

Instead, data scientists recover information and expertise from colleagues or learn via trial and error. Hence, this paper presents a scalable platform, KGLiDS, that employs machine learning and knowledge graph technologies to abstract and capture the semantics of data science artifacts and their connections. Based on this information, KGLiDS enables various downstream applications, such as data discovery and pipeline automation.

The most popular tools for these tasks are pandas and NumPy. However, these tools are limited to executing on a single node, making them unsuitable for processing large-scale data. Several systems have attempted to distribute data science applications to clusters while maintaining interfaces similar to single-node libraries, enabling data scientists to scale their workloads without significant effort. However, existing systems often struggle with processing large datasets due to Out-of-Memory (OOM) problems caused by poor data partitioning. To overcome these challenges, we develop Xorbits, a high-performance, scalable data science framework specifically designed to distribute data science workloads across clusters while retaining familiar APIs. The key differentiator of Xorbits is its ability to dynamically switch between graph construction and graph execution. Xorbits has been successfully deployed in production environments with up to 5k CPU cores. Its applications span various domains, including user behavior analysis and recommendation systems in the e-commerce sector, as well as credit assessment and risk management in the finance industry. Users can easily scale their data science workloads by simply changing the import line of their pandas and NumPy code. Our experiments demonstrate that Xorbits can effectively process very large datasets without encountering OOM or data-skewing problems. Over the fastest state-of-the-art solutions, Xorbits achieves an impressive 2.66 × speedup on average.

In recent literature, many patterns for the development of microservice architectures have evolved mainly for transaction-oriented applications. This paper investigates suitable design patterns for data science workflows. For this, we will implement a data science workflow using a microservice architecture, implemented with two different patterns, the orchestrator and choreography patterns, and with synchronous and asynchronous communication styles. Experiments are conducted to compare these architecture patterns with workloads of volume and velocity criteria. Orchestrator pattern performs best and could be used for inference, while choreography pattern could be used for training of machine learning models due to asynchronous communication. Our paper can provide practical support to software architects in implementing data science workflows using appropriate microservice design patterns. Also, we have now combined microservices pattern with data science workflows. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Computer Science,

This is due to the continual development of scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and computational tools that help to extract knowledge from raw data efficiently and cost-effectively, compared with early-generation tools. Professional data scientists create code that processes, analyses and extracts actionable insights from high volumes of data. This process requires a deep understanding of mathematical principles, statistics, business knowledge, and computer science. But most importantly, the data science development chain requires knowledge of a high-level programming tool and its dependencies. This is a major problem in some aspects due to the steep learning curve. In this paper, we describe and present a modularized Data Science curriculum for undergraduate learners that relies on no-code software development tools as programming aids for non-computer science majors. No-code development tools have been added to the traditional teaching pedagogy to improve students' motivation and conceptual understanding of coding despite their limited programming skills. The study aims to assess the impacts of visual programming languages on the performance of non-computer science majors on programming problems. The study's sample consists of 50 fourth-year students from the Faculty of Science and Technology at the Midlands State University. A post-survey questionnaire and assessment items were administered to the control and experimental groups. Results show that the students drawn from the experimental group benefited from the use of a visual programming language. These results offer evidence-based recommendations for incorporating high-performance no-code software development tools in the formal curriculum to aid teaching and learning data science programming for students of diverse academic backgrounds. © 2013 IEEE.",Computer Science,

A bibliometric analysis (BA) of scientific articles, technological developments, and patents in different sources of web information was implemented. Additionally, search algorithms and DS were designed to perform an analysis of trends from social media platforms in the avocado value chain. The BA identified patters associated with the avocado chain in Colombia, highlighting the increase in scientific-technical information, the grouping by work networks, the bias associated with departments and commercial varieties such as the high volume of works in Antioquia and cv.

This paper focuses on the design and development of a system for collecting and managing data provenance of data preparation pipelines in data science. An investigation of publicly available machine learning pipelines is conducted to identify the most important features required for the tool to achieve impact on a broad selection of preprocessing data manipulation. This reveals that the operations that are used in practice can be implemented by combining a rather limited set of basic operators. We then illustrate and test implementation choices aimed at supporting the provenance capture for those operations efficiently and with minimal effort for data scientists. © 2024 IEEE.",Computer Science,

It moves beyond pure data exploration to the organization of observations into meaningful groups, i.e., spatial clustering. This constitutes an important component of so-called unsupervised learning, a major aspect of modern machine learning. The distinctive aspects of the book are both to explore ways to spatialize classic clustering methods through linked maps and graphs, as well as the explicit introduction of spatial contiguity constraints into clustering algorithms. Leveraging a large number of real-world empirical illustrations, readers will gain an understanding of the main concepts and techniques and their relative advantages and disadvantages. The book also constitutes the definitive user’s guide for these methods as implemented in the GeoDa open source software for spatial analysis. It is organized into three major parts, dealing with dimension reduction (principal components, multidimensional scaling, stochastic network embedding), classic clustering methods (hierarchical clustering, k-means, k-medians, k-medoids and spectral clustering), and spatially constrained clustering methods (both hierarchical and partitioning). It closes with an assessment of spatial and non-spatial cluster properties. The book is intended for readers interested in going beyond simple mapping of geographical data to gain insight into interesting patterns as expressed in spatial clusters of observations. Familiarity with the material in Volume 1 is assumed, especially the analysis of local spatial autocorrelation and the full range of visualization methods. © 2024 Luc Anselin.",Multidisciplinary,

To gain an overview of the topic, 158 peer-reviewed articles were analysed through a semi-systematic literature review. The proportion of social science literature with a focus on risks of data science implies that policymakers are disproportionally influenced by a pessimistic view on military data science. The perceived risks of data science, however, are hardly addressed in formal science literature. Additionally, when levels of war are taken into account, relatively low attention for the operational level is observed. Literature reflects an emphasis on the tactical level when it comes to opportunities for military data science. On the contrary, studies examining the risks of military data science mostly consider the strategic level. Consequently, domain-specific requirements for military strategic data science may not be expressed. Lacking such applications ultimately leads to suboptimal strategic decisions in today’s warfare. © 2024 The Author(s).

The first phase uses an exponential-based friction force model to identify the model parameters by an autoregressive model and Z-transform. The second phase uses symbolic regression for the residual analysis to enhance the friction force estimation. An empirical study of three types of CNC machines under different working conditions is conducted to validate the two-phase data science framework and identify the change of the machining displacement considered to be a critical factor affecting friction force. The exponential-based model successfully eliminates the circular spike error caused by the friction force in the tapping center machine.

New optics, indicators, and experimental paradigms are now enabling in-vivo imaging from the synaptic to the cortex-wide scales. To match the resulting flood of data across scales, computational methods are continuously being developed to meet the need of extracting biologically relevant information. In this pursuit challenges arise in some domains (e.g., SNR and resolution limits in micron-scale data) that require specialized algorithms. These algorithms can, for example, make use of state-of-the-art machine learning to maximally learn the details of a given scale to optimize the processing pipeline. In contrast, other methods, however, such as graph signal processing, seek to abstract away from some of the details that are scale-specific to provide solution to specific sub-problems common across scales of neuroimaging.

The potency of AI and Data Science is deeply rooted in the successful resolution of these optimization problems, which are prevalent in areas such as machine learning model fine-tuning, operational research, and logistics. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that solutions to these optimization problems do not always come with guarantees. This does not necessarily imply that research is lacking in this direction. Instead, it is often a manifestation of the constraints imposed by the nature of the digital hardware used for calculations. Digital hardware is bound by physical limitations, including constraints on processing power, storage capacity, and time. A key limitation, however, is its inherent binary nature, which can handle only discrete values precisely and may struggle with mathematical functions on real variables.

However, DS project management is quite challenging due to its interdisciplinary nature. Existing DS process models, such as CRISP-DM, have limitations, resulting in low success rates for these undertakings. To address this issue, a novel methodology for the construction of patterns in DS project management has been proposed, using the Design Science Research methodology. The design draws inspiration from existing pattern concepts to address common problems in DS project execution. The methodology is demonstrated through the creation of patterns for best practices in DS project management, synthesized from scientific literature. The goal of this approach is to provide a platform for exchanging and standardizing best practices in DS project management. While initial demonstrations show the general applicability of the methodology, further evaluations and case studies are necessary to assess its effectiveness and areas for improvement. The study identifies potential ambiguities in certain activities within the process, suggesting opportunities for refinement. Overall, this research contributes to the field of DS project management by offering a structured method to encapsulate and disseminate effective practices, supporting the successful execution of data projects in organizations.

The phenomenon embodies both advantageous and detrimental discourses. On the one hand, data science systems in healthcare offer novel technologies to help private and public institutions aid in better decision-making. On the other hand, facial recognition software often jeopardizes fundamental human rights with invasive and discriminatory algorithms. While making data science systems, practitioners are typically encouraged to execute project management methodology CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) to complete projects successfully. Created for data mining projects, CRISP-DM guides the management of data science projects with six phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. This work-in-progress conceptual paper uses an intersectional feminist framework to critically analyze CRISP-DM for data science projects.

Given the ease of exchanging information online, separating false information from reliable information is a crucial endeavor. Using bag-of-words and consecutive mining approaches, we provide a data mining solution in this work to categorize articles as genuine or fake. We also compare the accuracy of the solution for identifying fake news across different datasets. Our method first purifies the input information by normalizing words and eliminating “filler” words. The cleansed data is then vectorized using sequential mining techniques. After that, it uses vectorized data to train the classification models and categorizes unknown news as authentic or fake. Assessment of our technology to mine and categorize bogus news using actual data demonstrates its viability. The classification algorithms are then trained using vectorized data to categorize unreported news as real or bogus. The effectiveness of our technology in identifying and categorize bogus news has been evaluated using real-world data. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",Computer Science,

As the project matures, the business requirements may change over time. In addition, uncertainties associated with data integrity, quantity, and quality can have an impact on the success of the project. The effectiveness of advanced analytics and algorithms that is changing depending on the complexity of the project and ambiguities in project values potentially will lead to adverse effects on deliverables and task prioritization. Agile-scrum framework enables projects with time-boxed iterations (sprints). It also introduces delivery through increments (MVPs) that assist in reaching the overall aim or vision of the product. However, backlog prioritization and sequence of tasks is not bounded by any criteria and depends fully on product owner's understanding of product goal and value. On the other hand, CRISP-DM is a solid place to start for advising developers on the steps and tasks needed to build a data science product. It enables exploratory and discovery work through iterations to satisfy the requirements of the data science project. However, the lack of time element within the process might cause infinite iterative cycles and delay delivery to customers. At Petronas, we have integrated a hybrid strategy that envelops the CRISP-DM process within defined time-limited sprints. The process flow from CRISP-DM can help to plan which tasks to be assigned in which sprint. Properly assigned scrum team roles will ensure proper establishment of scrum. Furthermore, conducting scrum events will enable effective and productive customers engagement. Periodic inspection of scrum artifacts will also ensure alignment with product goals. This hybrid approach demonstrates how the change in requirements can be strategically addressed by utilizing the Agile-Scrum CRISP-DM methodology while ensuring that the product goal is achieved. It also highlights how Agile-Scrum ensures successful delivery of product, maximizing product value, and customer satisfaction, while CRISP-DM can guide us in planning for data science project sprints.

Achieving these goals requires innovation in health informatics. The Centre for Health Informatics (CHI) within the Cumming School of Medicine (CSM) at the University of Calgary (UC), Canada, was created to respond to this need by fostering multidisciplinary collaborations, building capacity by recruiting and training outstanding faculty and students, and harnessing Alberta’s rich health data to advance health informatics. To establish CHI as a health informatics leader, CHI has struck partnerships with stakeholders, including Alberta Health Services (AHS), Alberta Health (AH), and the Alberta Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research Unit (AbSPORU) among others. Through these close relationships, the CHI intake team facilitates access to Alberta’s rich health data sources and educates researchers on the available health data in Alberta. The concept of a “One Stop Shop” for CSM and UC researchers encourages multidisciplinary collaboration, helps investigators access a wide range of datasets, and receive analytical support. Population-based data sets enable the development of methods to turn raw data into health information, improve health data collection, linkage, analysis, and quality, and applied studies creating clinical decision-support tools, prognostic tools, improved health surveillance methods, and health system performance indicators.

From a technical point of view, there is an overall agreement that disciplines based on data require to combine data engineering and data analysis skills, but the fact is that data engineering is nowadays trailing and catching up with the rapid changes in the data analysis landscape. To unleash the real power of data, data-centric systems must be professionalized, i.e., operationalized and systematized, so that repetitive, time-consuming and error-prone tasks are automated. To such end, we propose our vision on next generation data governance for data-centric systems based on knowledge graphs.

As a consequence, MOFS typically returns a large set of non-dominated solutions, which have to be assessed by the data scientist in order to proceed with the final choice. Given the multi-variate nature of the assessment, which may include objectives (e.g., fairness) unrelated to predictive accuracy, this step is often not straightforward and suffers from the lack of existing tools. For instance, it is common to make use of a tabular presentation of the solutions, which provides little information about the trade-offs and the relationships between objectives over the set of solutions. Adopting a GA-based MOFS with six objectives (number of selected features, balanced accuracy, F1-Score, variance inflation factor, statistical parity, and equalised odds) for two feature selection tasks, this paper illustrates the complex challenge of assessing MOFS results and the need for a methodology to aid and justify the final choice of a solution. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

This paper discusses an approach for bridging the gap between Computational Thinking with Data Science by employing and studying classification as a higher-order thinking process that connects the two. To achieve that, we designed and developed an online constructionist gaming tool called SorBET which integrates coding and database design enabling students to interpret, organize, and analyze data through game play and game design. The paper presents and discusses the results of a pilot study that aimed to investigate the data practices secondary students develop through playing and modifying SorBET games, and to determine the impact of game modding on student critical engagement with CT. According to the results, students developed and used certain data practices such as data interpretation and data model design to become better players or to design an interesting classification game. Moreover, game modding process motivated students to question the original games’ content, leading them to develop a critical stance towards the game data model and representations. © 2024 Vilnius University",Social Sciences,

First, a workflow for fatigue life prediction of flame-resistant magnesium alloy welded joints was proposed. The workflow consists of thermo-elastic-plastic analysis simulating welding, macroscopic stress field analysis to identify stress concentration zones, crack initiation analysis using crystal plasticity analysis and Tanaka-Mura model, and crack propagation analysis using finite element method and Paris’ law. The fatigue life calculations were repeatedly performed by using the proposed workflow for different shapes of weld toe, excess weld metal and undercut, and the results were compiled into a database. A surrogate model was developed from the database by machine learning to predict the fatigue indicator parameter (FIP), which is an index of crack initiation life obtained by the Tanaka-Mura model. The effect of weld geometry on fatigue life was evaluated by exploring the surrogate model using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The results obtained are consistent with the previous findings that toe radius and undercut depth have a strong influence on fatigue. © 2024 Japan Institute of Light Metals.

First, we delineate the approach in more theoretical detail by discussing how the goal of RCR training is to foster the cultivation of certain moral abilities. We specify the nature of these ‘abilities’: while the ideal is the cultivation of virtues, the limited space allowed by RCR modules can only facilitate the cultivation of superficial abilities or proto-virtues, which help students to familiarize themselves with moral and political issues in the data science environment. Third, we operationalize our approach by stressing that (proto-)virtue acquisition (like skill acquisition) occurs through the technical and social tasks of daily data science activities, where these repetitive tasks provide the opportunities to develop (proto-)virtue capacity and to support the development of ethically robust data systems. Finally, we discuss a concrete example of implementing this approach.

Therefore, commercial banking system is increasingly moving towards international standards is a prerequisite to ensure the reduction of systemic risks in banking. Besides, commercial banks and the financial industry face considerable hurdles in light of the fourth Covid-19 outbreak. Commercial banks continuously put capital adequacy measures in place to fulfill Basel regulations. One of the main ways they do this is by issuing bonds, which boost tier 2 capital sources. This helps mobilize capital and assure capital safety for the market's borrowing requirements in the long run. As a result, considering both external and internal variables, this research seeks to investigate what influences the capital adequacy ratio of Vietnam's joint-stock commercial banks. Between 2011 and 2022, the authors combed through data from 25 different Vietnamese joint-stock commercial banks. The authors employed the system generalized method of moments model and other conventional techniques for panel data analysis. The study's findings had fourteen components affecting the capital adequacy ratio, with a significance of 0.01. Therefore, it is evident that the equity capital of Vietnamese commercial banks has successfully met the required safety standards for assets with credit risk as per legislation. As a result, this assists Vietnamese commercial banks in managing potential losses from credit activities, thus assuring the security of banking operations and protecting depositors. However, the issue suggests policy implications for enhancing Vietnamese commercial banks' future capital adequacy ratio coefficient. © Authors retain all copyrights.",Chemical Engineering,

We suggest, however, that designing a process for asking the right questions can play an important role in ensuring that data is used responsibly and with maximum positive social impact. More generally, we argue that, combined with other methods and approaches, questions can help achieve a variety of key data responsibility goals, including data minimization and proportionality, increasing participation and enhancing accountability. In addition to 'data science,' we need to invest in creating a new kind of 'question science’ that can contribute to data responsibility.

Feature selection, enabled by RF, is often among the very first tasks in a data science project, such as the college capstone project, industry consulting projects. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of 12 RF-based feature selection methods for classification problems. The review provides necessary description of each method and the software packages. We show that different methods typically do not provide consistent feature selection results, and the model performance also varies when different RF-based feature selection approaches are employed. This observation suggests that caution must be taken when performing feature selection tasks using RF. Feature selection cannot be blindly done without a sound understanding of the methods adopted, which is not always the case in industry and many senior capstone projects that we have observed.

While numerous studies attempted to develop intelligent classifiers for anticipating student achievement, they overlooked the importance of identifying the key factors that lead to the achieved performance. Such identification is essential to empower program leaders to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of their academic programs and thereby take the necessary corrective interventions to ameliorate student achievements. To this end, our paper contributes, to begin with, a hybrid approach of factor analysis that combines various data science approaches. The prediction of student performance is produced by combining baseline models, cross-validation, and factor analysis. We empirically investigate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our entire approach on four datasets. The experimental results show considerable improvements compared to single baseline models, demonstrating the practicality of the proposed approach in pinpointing multiple factors impacting student performance. The result proves that the hybrid algorithm combining cross-validation and factor analysis approaches yields results that are far superior in terms of achieving accuracy in prediction of academic performance of the students. The model may be successfully extended to other programs to predict the performance of the students. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Engineering,

After mortality and during morbidity, relevant data about a health problem have been gathered. This massive amount of data in various forms needs to be handled for any healthcare issues are significant. With the growth of big data in healthcare communities, accurate analysis of medical data has the benefits of early disease detection, improved patient care, and effective community services. Because of its significance, there is a need to develop efficient and better-performing data analytics techniques and tools to analyze medical big data from the gene level to the clinical level. The purpose of data analytics in healthcare is to find new insights in data, at least partially automate tasks such as diagnosing, and to facilitate clinical decision-making. Also, healthcare analytics has the potential to reduce costs of treatment, predict outbreaks of disease, avoid preventable diseases, and improve the quality of life in general. The average human lifespan is increasing across the world population and the application of big data analytics in healthcare are increasing day by day. Different format of health data are used for different types of analyses. For example, IoT gadgets are used by certain patients and clinicians as wearable monitors to track heartbeat and temperature. This signal generated data should be carefully analyzed over time. Also, scans such as X-rays, magnetic resonance images (MRIs), and computed tomography (CAT) scans can be studied with different data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to visualize the insides of the body in depth. In addition, data on individual cases of disease are analyzed; data received as text must be sorted, categorized, and coded for statistical analysis; and data from surveys might need to be weighted to produce valid estimates for sampled populations. The number of resources healthcare professionals can obtain from their patients continues to increase. Since these data are normally in different formats and sizes, it can be difficult for analysis. However, the current focus is no longer on how big the data is, but how intelligently it is managed by data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms. This study examines analytical techniques for different forms of health-related data to generate comprehensive healthcare reports and transform them into relevant critical insights that can then be used to provide better care. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Computer Science,

Guidance for identifying, developing and managing successful partnerships for DSUs can be summarized in six rules: (1) align with institutional strategic plans, (2) cultivate partnerships that fit your mission, (3) ensure sustainability and prepare for growth, (4) define clear expectations in a partnership agreement, (5) communicate and (6) expect the unexpected. While these rules are not exhaustive, they are derived from experiences in a diverse set of DSUs, which vary by administrative home, mission, staffing and funding model. As examples in this paper illustrate, these rules can be adapted to different organizational models for DSUs. Clear expectations in partnership agreements are essential for high quality and consistent collaborations and address core activities, duration, staffing, cost and evaluation. A DSU is an organizational asset that should involve thoughtful investment if the institution is to gain real value. © 2024 The Authors. Stat published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Medicine,

Team behaviours are widely heterogeneous in terms of the performance of their solutions and the participation in knowledge creation. We present a novel research framework for open innovation by integrating system dynamics and structural topic modelling to extract open factors and adopting a machine learning-based difference-in-differences estimator to understand the impact of team behaviour on their performance using data from Kaggle's competition. Our results identify four team behaviour categories—active, learner, lurker, and passive— in data science open innovation competitions which depend on the performance of their solutions and actions related to posting and reading messages in the forum. Furthermore, the activities of model evaluation, community support, and business understanding are the top three most positive and significant factors affecting team performance. Our research contributes to the literature by highlighting the value of forum feedback and exploring the data science activities in the forum discussion, in relation to innovation performance, to enrich the empirical understanding of open innovation.

Identifying trends or insights regarding security occurrences in cyber security data and creating a data-driven model that correlates with them are essential elements in creating an automated and intelligent safety system. This means gathering data from pertinent cyber security sources and applying analytics to improve the most recent trends based on data. The article also highlights important variables that affect the design choices made for the control, communication, redundancy, and reliability of ICS, as these aspects are crucial in figuring out the security requirements of the system. Network segmentation, access control, patches management, and security monitoring are just a few of the security countermeasures that are currently in place. Additionally, the paper investigates how machine learning methods might be integrated to improve ICS cyber security. Subsequently, we list the pros and cons of the available security solutions, talk about how to secure industrial control systems (ICSs) and implement additional security measures (like risk assessment methodologies), point out unresolved security research issues related to ICSs, and make recommendations for future directions in ICS security research. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

Currently, this process is manual and tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays data distributions and summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one version updates reactively ('live') and the other updates only on demand ('dead'). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight discovery with 91% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than manual profiling code written by users. Participants found live updates intuitive and felt it helped them verify their transformations while those with on-demand profiles liked the ability to look at past visualizations. We also present a longitudinal case study on how AutoProfiler helped domain scientists find serendipitous insights about their data through automatic, live data profiles. Our results have implications for the design of future tools that offer automated data analysis support. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",Computer Science,

This type of inquiry necessitates qualitative methods, which allow for a holistic description of the skills a student uses throughout the computing code they produce, the organization of these descriptions into themes, and a comparison of the emergent themes across students or across time. In this article we share how to conceptualize and carry out the qualitative coding process with students’ computing code.

The simplest definition to come up with is, it is the study of data. The real-world data is raw and data science uses tools and techniques to extract meaningful information from the raw data. It incorporates different fields such as statistics, mathematics, computer engineering, machine learning, data miming, and artificial intelligence to analyze large amount of data. Nowadays there are various applications available to automatically capture and store this large amount of data such as online system and payment portals. Organizations are overwhelmed with this huge data and want to make inferences as to enhance business and productivity also to give users a better experience. Data science is helping to reveal gaps and uncovering new patterns take it from health, medicine, finance to e-commerce. Data science is a broader term, which consider multiple challenges, such as capturing, cleaning and transforming data to finally make inferences from it. Whereas data mining is mainly about extracting knowledge and unknown patterns from the huge amount of data hence it is also called “knowledge discovery process”. On the other hand, machine learning is an automated technique which uses complex algorithms for data processing and providing trained model output or we can say that it is a technique to train model on the given data and make predictions. Artificial Intelligence goes one step ahead and uses machine learning algorithm to make intelligent systems which can work on their own. These techniques have made data processing faster and much more efficient. It is because of different expertise required in this field, data science is showing strong growth. © 2024 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.",Computer Science,

We derive our recommendations from directed graphs of known analysis states, with two input sources: one manually curated from online data science tutorials, and another extracted through semi-automatic analysis of a corpus of over 6000 Jupyter notebooks. We validated Lodestar through three separate user studies: first a formative evaluation involving novices learning data science using the tool. We used the feedback from this study to improve the tool. This was followed by a summative study involving both new and returning participants from the formative evaluation to test the efficacy of our improvements.

Our proposed module is guided by active learning principles: In addition to lecture materials on variational inference, we provide an accompanying class activity, an R shiny app, and guided labs based on real data applications of logistic regression and clustering documents using Latent Dirichlet Allocation with R code. The main goal of our module is to expose students to a method that facilitates statistical modeling and inference with large datasets. Using our proposed module as a foundation, instructors can adopt and adapt it to introduce more realistic case studies and applications in data science, Bayesian statistics, multivariate analysis, and statistical machine learning courses. © 2023 American Statistical Association.",Social Sciences,

In translating scholarship around culturally relevant pedagogy from the fields of education and mathematics education we develop the idea of culturally relevant data. We see this development as a key ingredient to implementing culturally relevant pedagogy in teaching data-intensive courses leveraging the centrality of context through data in both statistics and data science to engage students particularly from historically marginalized groups in STEM. We provide suggestions as to ways of finding or creating culturally relevant data and using them in implementing culturally relevant pedagogy to support the learning and flourishing of students in statistics and data science courses. We also present findings from pilot work we have done in implementing these data in statistics courses. Finally, we discuss lingering questions and possible next steps for research in this area.

As a result, there is a growing body of research regarding how to teach interdisciplinary collaboration skills. However, much of the work evaluating methods of teaching statistics and data science collaboration relies primarily on self-reflection data. Additionally, prior research lacks detailed methods for assessing the quality of collaboration skills. In this case study, we present a method for teaching statistics and data science collaboration, a framework for identifying elements of effective collaboration, and a comparative case study to evaluate the collaboration skills of both a team of students and an experienced collaborator on two components of effective data science collaboration: structuring a collaboration meeting and communicating with a domain expert. Results show that the students could facilitate meetings and communicate comparably well to the experienced collaborator, but that the experienced collaborator was better able to facilitate meetings and communicate to develop strong relationships, an important element for high-quality and long-term collaboration. Further work is needed to generalize these findings to a larger population, but these results begin to inform the field regarding effective ways to teach specific data science collaboration skills. © 2023 The Author(s).

A key finding from this study is the importance of a simple teaching software tool and security case studies. The module boosted knowledge of key concepts and awareness of ‘big data’ accountability issues. We also found that teaching data-science concepts–even at an elementary level–requires that students have basic proficiencies working with datasets and spreadsheets, which suggests the need to integrate these skills throughout security studies curricula.

The premium should then be some function of these three values. We focus on risk assessment using a data science approach. Instead of using the traditional frequency and severity metrics, we instead predict the total claims that will be made by a new customer using historical data of current and past policies. Given multiple features of the policy (age and gender of drivers, value of car, previous accidents, etc.), one can potentially try to provide personalized insurance policies based specifically on these features as follows. We can compute the average claims made per year of all past and current policies with identical features and then take an average over these claim rates. Unfortunately there may not be sufficient samples to obtain a robust average. We can instead try to include policies that are “similar” to obtain sufficient samples for a robust average. We therefore face a trade-off between personalization (only using closely similar policies) and robustness (extending the domain far enough to capture sufficient samples). This is known as the bias–variance trade-off. We model this problem and determine the optimal trade-off between the two (i.e., the balance that provides the highest prediction accuracy) and apply it to the claim rate prediction problem. We demonstrate our approach using real data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Social Sciences,

However, while these developments add new features to the recommendation systems, the question of whether a novel solution would excel in practice remains. Open innovation and crowdsourcing platforms are becoming an arena for designers to test their solutions in business competitions. We show how structural topical modeling identifies topical themes that improve contestant performance using forum message data during the competition period. Our topic modeling analysis identifies technological and business issues that emerge in recommendation system development. An econometric framework further investigates the link between topic distribution and performance. The multiperiod difference-in-differences estimator reports no significant statistical relation when linking all message communications to the performance. However, topic-dominant and topic-dispersed messages are both found to positively and significantly impact performance. Our result shows that structural topical modeling has an essential role to critically examine the most valuable message links to boost performance. Stakeholders may prioritize the messages with specific topics and/or a mixture of topics. We provide research and practical implications for researchers, business analysts, developers, and managers to improve their experiences when engaging in recommendation system design on platforms. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Engineering,

Scatterplots are useful for exploratory analysis, but can do much more than just identifying correlations. As data sets get larger and more complex, relying solely on “eye power” alone may cause us to miss interesting associations, or worse, make wrong interpretations. We show that by combining scatterplots with statistical and logical reasoning (the sliding window and two-axis median bisection), we may identify interesting associations in a case study of Graduate Record Examination admission versus graduation outcomes, and whether low detectability of proteins in a biological sample are truly associated with low abundance. Due to subjective visual interpretability, we recommend graphing the data using a multitude of visual variables and graph types before concluding the absence of an association. Finally, even if associations are demonstrable, developing causal models that could explain the observed fuzziness and lack of apparent correlations in the scatterplot are helpful for better decision-making and interpretation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Multidisciplinary,

Methods: The editors follow a systematic approach to gather relevant articles and select the best papers for the section. This year, they updated the query to incorporate the topic of telemedicine and removed search terms related to geographic information systems. The revised query resulted in a larger number of identified papers, necessitating the appointment of a third section editor to handle the increased workload. The editors narrowed the initial pool of articles to 15 candidate papers through a multi-stage selection process. At least seven independent reviews were collected for each candidate paper, and a selection meeting with the IMIA Yearbook editorial board led to the final selection of the best papers for the CIS section. Results: The query was carried out in mid-January 2023 and retrieved a deduplicated result set of 5,206 articles from 1,500 journals. This year, 15 papers were nominated as candidates, and four were finally selected as the best papers in the CIS section. Including telemedicine in the query resulted in a substantial increase in the number of papers found. The analysis highlights the growing convergence between clinical information systems and telemedicine, with mobile health (mHealth) technologies and data science applications gaining prominence. The selected candidate papers emphasize the practical impact of research efforts, focusing on patient-centric outcomes and benefits, including intelligent mobile health monitoring systems and AI-assisted decision-making in healthcare. Conclusions: Looking ahead, the field of CIS is expected to continue evolving, driven by advances in telemedicine, mHealth technologies, data science, and AI integration, leading to more efficient, patient-oriented, and intelligent healthcare systems and overall improvement of global healthcare outcomes. © The Author(s) 2023.",Medicine,

Since computational methods as well as computer-based approaches are less expensive and efficient, these techniques are very helpful to analyze chemical compounds. Chemical graph theory is a field that includes such kinds of analyses of chemical structures. Graph descriptors, also referred as topological indices, are graph invariants that help to study different structural properties of chemical substances. Such descriptors also aid to understand different activities related to chemical compounds. The main objective of this study is to find the best appropriate index to estimate the heat of formation of SF6. Initially, we compute degree-based topological indices, co-indices, and reverse indices for Sulfur hexafluoride. A similarity measure is used for feature selection. A network of the indices is constructed based on a similarity measure which is defined using Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation. Next, twenty-one subnetworks of the network consisting of highly similar indices, referred as modules, are captured. One module is containing 13 indices, three are containing 2 indices, and all the remaining modules are comprised of only one vertex. Hierarchical clustering is used to verify the detected modules. From each module one index, called master regulatory index (MRI), is selected for further study. Afterward, the thermodynamical measure heat of formation (HOF) is computed. A correlation analysis is done between each master regulatory index and heat of formation to capture any uncorrelated feature, if exists. Finally, mathematical formulations between each MRI and HOF are estimated. The best estimate is selected based on root mean squared error. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Engineering,

Stemming from a UC Berkeley seminar on experimental design for machine learning tasks, these techniques aim to overcome the 'black box' approach of machine learning by reducing conjectures such as magic numbers (hyper-parameters) or model-type bias. Information-based machine learning enables data quality measurements, a priori task complexity estimations, and reproducible design of data science experiments. The benefits include significant size reduction, increased explainability, and enhanced resilience of models, all contributing to advancing the discipline's robustness and credibility. While bridging the gap between machine learning and disciplines such as physics, information theory, and computer engineering, this textbook maintains an accessible and comprehensive style, making complex topics digestible fora broad readership. Information-Driven Machine Learning explores the synergistic harmony among these disciplines to enhance our understanding of data science modeling. Instead of solely focusing on the ""how,"" this text provides answers to the ""why"" questions that permeate the field, shedding light on the underlying principles of machine learning processes and their practical implications. By advocating for systematic methodologies grounded in fundamental principles, this book challenges industry practices that have often evolved from ideologic or profit-driven motivations. It addresses a range of topics, including deep learning, data drift, and MLOps, using fundamental principles such as entropy, capacity, and high dimensionality. Ideal for both academia and industry professionals, this textbook serves as a valuable tool for those seeking to deepen their understanding of data science as an engineering discipline. Its thought-provoking content stimulates intellectual curiosity and caters to readers who desire more than just code or ready-made formulas. The text invites readers to explore beyond conventional viewpoints, offering an alternative perspective that promotes a big-picture view for integrating theory with practice. Suitable for upper undergraduate or graduate-level courses, this book can also benefit practicing engineers and scientists in various disciplines by enhancing their understanding of modeling and improving data measurement effectively. © The Editor(s)(if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

Solar energy figures as a natural option, despite its intermittence. Brazil has a green energy matrix with significant expansion of solar form in recent years. To preserve the Amazon basin, the use of solar energy can help communities and cities improve their living standards without new hydroelectric units or even to burn biomass, avoiding harsh environmental consequences. The novelty of this work is using data science with machine-learning tools to predict the solar incidence (W.h/m ) in four cities in Amazonas state (north-west Brazil), using data from NASA satellites within the period of 2013-22. Decision-tree-based models and vector autoregressive (time-series) models were used with three time aggregations: day, week and month. The predictor model can aid in the economic assessment of solar energy in the Amazon basin and the use of satellite data was encouraged by the lack of data from ground stations.

In this study, we ascertained the impact of data science and AI education on learners’ motivation and career development by analyzing a lecture-style course offered as part of mathematical and data science education at Tokyo City University, Japan. The course analyzed was Data Science Literacy 1 (DS1). The analysis period spanned three academic years, from 2020 to 2022. The analyzed items were three motivational factors derived from expectancy-value theory, namely intrinsic value, attainment utility value, and expectations for success. A fourth factor, career development, was also analyzed. We collected data pertaining to the four factors, that is, the three above mentioned motivational factors and career development, through questionnaires administered to DS1 learners. Regarding data analysis, learners were clas-sified according to the values (high vs. low) they reported for each of the four factors of interest at the beginning of the course. These were compared to the values reported at the end of the course. Results showed increases in all the motivation factors. The increasing trend was particularly pronounced among learners who initially reported low values. Although trends differed from year to year, the results suggest that data science and AI education can positively impact motivational factors and related career development. © 2023, ICIC International.

Considering the complexities in real-world systems (e.g., noisy data sets and high dimensionality) and challenges in mathematical foundation of machine learning, this review presents two perspectives in the interaction between stochastic dynamical systems and data science. On the one hand, deep learning helps to improve first principle-based methods for stochastic dynamical systems. AI for science, combining machine learning methods with available scientific understanding, is becoming a valuable approach to study stochastic dynamical systems with the help of observation data. On the other hand, a challenge is the theoretical explanations for deep learning. It is crucial to build explainable deep learning structures with the help of stochastic dynamical systems theory in order to demonstrate how and why deep learning works. In this review, we seek better understanding of the mathematical foundation of the state-of-the-art techniques in data science, with the help of stochastic dynamical systems, and we further apply machine learning tools for studying stochastic dynamical systems. This is achieved through stochastic analysis, algorithm development, and computational implementation. Topics involved with this review include Stochastic Analysis, Dynamical Systems, Inverse Problems, Data Assimilation, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, Nonparametric Statistics, Uncertainty Quantification, Deep Learning, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

It is essential to minimise the failure of data science projects, for both businesses and data professionals. Human systems are critical to the success of data science innovations. However, the human aspects of innovation management are often neglected or omitted in most guidelines and frameworks for data science. This provides limited guidance about the necessary human conditions for successful data science innovations. In this article we address this concern by developing a systematic framework for understanding human systems that support data science innovations. We first reviewed the elements of human system at different levels of analysis and how they contribute to innovation. Substantial research and theory indicate successful innovation requires supports at different levels of organisations, which combine to create the organisation's innovation capability. The review provided an initial framework for integrating human systems with data science innovations. Then, we drew on a series of interviews with key innovators engaged in developing current data science innovations. The interviews generated a more complete picture of human systems in practice. The findings support a range of practices to energise and facilitate innovation as an integral part of strategic planning and business processes. This study contributes to the advancement of innovation management theories and calls attention to guiding and engaging individuals through providing support and removing barriers to data science at different organisational levels. More practically, innovation managers could use this as a guide to optimise work systems and inform pathways to improve organisation data science efforts. © 2023 The Authors",Medicine,

However, LORs are highly subjective and thus can inject recommender bias into the process, leading to an inequitable evaluation of the candidates’ competitiveness and competence. Our study utilizes natural language processing methods and manually determined ratings to investigate gender and cultural differences and biases in LORs written for STEM Master’s program applicants. We generate features to measure important characteristics of the LORs and then compare these characteristics across groups based on recommender gender, applicant gender, and applicant country of origin. One set of features, which measure the underlying sentiment, tone, and emotions associated with each LOR, is automatically generated using IBM Watson’s Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service. The second set of features is measured manually by our research team and quantifies the relevance, specificity, and positivity of each LOR. We identify and discuss features that exhibit statistically significant differences across gender and culture study groups.

However, there is limited available information in easily understandable language for the public explaining how technology relates to them and could influence their healthcare. The researchers, healthcare professionals and public members worked together collaboratively to address this problem by creating new materials for the public. Our paper explores that project through creative methods. Firstly, everyone involved was offered an opportunity to attend training sessions. Then, people took photos and described them to illustrate to others what is their experience of working together. Finally, we all met to use included photos as building blocks to present a shared experience in the project. Afterwards, the professional artist included it as one circular illustration with six interlinked layers. These layers present everyone’s experiences (from inside) (1) is about the opportunity to build confidence in a new topic, (2) relationships with others, (3) working remotely during the pandemic, (4) motivation that influenced people to become involved in this particular piece of work, (5) expectation that the project needs be inclusive and accessible, (6) ethical principles that researchers using new technology should follow. We showed that it is possible for researchers, healthcare professionals and members of the public to feel joint ownership of the project and that working together can be meaningful to everyone. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature. Background: The growth of data science and artificial intelligence offers novel healthcare applications and research possibilities. Patients should be able to make informed choices about using healthcare. Therefore, they must be provided with lay information about new technology. A team consisting of academic researchers, health professionals, and public contributors collaboratively co-designed and co-developed the new resource offering that information. In this paper, we evaluate this novel approach to co-production. Methods: We used participatory evaluation to understand the co-production process. This consisted of creative approaches and reflexivity over three stages. Firstly, everyone had an opportunity to participate in three online training sessions. The first one focused on the aims of evaluation, the second on photovoice (that included practical training on using photos as metaphors), and the third on being reflective (recognising one’s biases and perspectives during analysis). During the second stage, using photovoice, everyone took photos that symbolised their experiences of being involved in the project. This included a session with a professional photographer. At the last stage, we met in person and, using data collected from photovoice, built the mandala as a representation of a joint experience of the project. This stage was supported by professional artists who summarised the mandala in the illustration. Results: The mandala is the artistic presentation of the findings from the evaluation. It is a shared journey between everyone involved. We divided it into six related layers. Starting from inside layers present the following experiences (1) public contributors had space to build confidence in a new topic, (2) relationships between individuals and within the project, (3) working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, (4) motivation that influenced people to become involved in this particular piece of work, (5) requirements that co-production needs to be inclusive and accessible to everyone, (6) expectations towards data science and artificial intelligence that researchers should follow to establish public support. Conclusions: The participatory evaluation suggests that co-production around data science and artificial intelligence can be a meaningful process that is co-owned by everyone involved. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Medicine,

The software is to be plugged into a modern hospital domain, where electronic patient records are used to handle the entire patient’s history. Most research institutes follow the same procedures to build study cohorts, but mainly in a non-standardized and repetitive way. As a result, researchers spend time writing boilerplate code, which could be used for more challenging tasks. Methods: The package can improve and simplify existing processes in the clinical research environment. It collects all needed functionalities into a straightforward interface that can be used to query a FHIR server, download imaging studies and filter clinical documents. The full capacity of the search mechanism of the FHIR REST API is available to the user, leading to a uniform querying process for all resources, thus simplifying the customization of each use case. Additionally, valuable features like parallelization and filtering are included to make it more performant. Results: As an exemplary practical application, the package can be used to analyze the prognostic significance of routine CT imaging and clinical data in breast cancer with tumor metastases in the lungs. In this example, the initial patient cohort is first collected using ICD-10 codes. For these patients, the survival information is also gathered. Some additional clinical data is retrieved, and CT scans of the thorax are downloaded. Finally, the survival analysis can be computed using a deep learning model with the CT scans, the TNM staging and positivity of relevant markers as input. This process may vary depending on the FHIR server and available clinical data, and can be customized to cover even more use cases. Conclusions: FHIR-PYrate opens up the possibility to quickly and easily retrieve FHIR data, download image data, and search medical documents for keywords within a Python package.

Such a stratification has led to plethora of designs of clinical trials that are often too complex due to the need for incorporating biomarkers and tissue types. Many statistical methods have been developed to address these issues; however, by the time such methodology is available research in cancer has moved on to new challenges and therefore in order to avoid playing catch-up it is necessary to develop new analytic tools alongside. One of the challenges facing cancer therapy is to effectively and appropriately target multiple therapies for sensitive patient population based on a panel of biomarkers across multiple cancer types, and matched future trial designs. We present novel geometric methods (mathematical theory of hypersurfaces) to visualise complex cancer therapeutics data as multidimensional, as well as geometric representation of oncology trial design space in higher dimensions. The hypersurfaces are used to describe master protocols, with application to a specific example of a basket trial design for melanoma, and thus setup a framework for further incorporating multi-omics data as multidimensional therapeutics. © 2023, The Author(s).",Medicine,

To date, endeavors on instrumentation have advanced CRS into a powerful analytical tool for studies of cell functions and in situ clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, the small cross-section of Raman scattering sets up a physical boundary for the design space of a CRS system, which trades off speed, signal fidelity and spectral bandwidth. The synergistic combination of instrumentation and computational approaches offers a way to break the trade-off. In this review, we first introduce coherent Raman scattering and recent instrumentation developments, then discuss current computational CRS imaging methods, including compressive micro-spectroscopy, computational volumetric imaging, as well as machine learning algorithms that improve system performance and decipher chemical information.

Big data analysis (BDA) is the preferred approach to unleash hidden knowledge. However, BDA consumes excessive resources and time. These limitations hamper the meaningful adoption of BDA, especially the time and situation critical edge use cases, and hinder the goals of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. Automating the BDA process at the edge is a cognitive approach to address the aforementioned concerns. Data science workflow is an indispensable challenge for successful automation. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature survey on data science workflow platforms as the first contribution. Moreover, we learned that the BDA workflow depends on diversified constraints and undergoes rigorous data-mining stages. These caused an increase in the solution space, dynamic constraints, complexity issues, and NP-hardness of BDA workflow. Graphplan is a heuristic AI-planning technique that can address concerns associated with BDA workflow. Therefore, as the second contribution, we adopted the graphplan to generate a workflow for edge-based BDA automation.

At the same time, philosophers of science face the challenge of making their expertise accessible for scientists in such a way that it can improve everyday research practice. Here, we investigate the possibility of approaching these challenges together. In current and proposed approaches to biomedical data science education, we identify a dominant focus on only one aspect of conducting scientific research: understanding and using data, research methods, and statistical methods. We argue that this approach cannot solve biomedical data science’s challenge and we propose to shift the focus to four other aspects of conducting research: making and justifying decisions in research design and implementation, explaining their epistemic and non-epistemic effects, balancing varying responsibilities, and reporting scientific research. Attending to these aspects requires learning on different dimensions than solely learning to apply techniques (first dimension). It also requires learning to make choices (second dimension) and to understand the rationale behind choices (third dimension). This could be fostered by integrating philosophical training in biomedical data science education. Furthermore, philosophical training fosters a fourth dimension of learning, namely, understanding the nature of science. In this article, we explain how we identified the five aspects of conducting research and the four dimensions of learning, and why attending to the fourth dimension is essential. We discuss educational approaches to attend to all aspects and dimensions, and present initial design principles to implement these approaches. © 2022, The Author(s).",Social Sciences,

While this method is feasible for processes communicating over any network, in this work we focus on edge-fog-cloud infrastructures. In a diagnostic phase, a model based on the Bernoulli principle is used to create a representation of bottlenecks in a pipeline. In a supervision phase, a watchman/sentinel cooperative system monitors the throughput of the pipeline stages to create a bottleneck-stage scheme. In a rectification phase, this system produces replicas of bottlenecks stages, mitigating the workload congestion using implicit parallelism and load balancing algorithms. This method is automatically and transparently invoked to produce a steady continuum dataflow. To test our proposal, we conducted a case study about the processing of medical and satellite data.

Therefore, DS processes will likely continue to attract Software Engineering (SE) practices and vice-versa. This case study aims to map and describe a software development process for Machine Learning(ML)-enabled applications and associated practices used in a real DS project at the Recod.ai laboratory in collaboration with an industrial partner. The focus was to analyze the process and identify the strengths and primary challenges, considering their expertise in robust ML practices and how they can contribute to general software quality. To achieve this, we conducted semi-structured interviews and analyzed them using procedures from the Straussian Grounded Theory. The results showed that the DS development process is iterative, with feedback between activities, which differs from the processes in the literature. Additionally, this process presents a greater involvement of domain experts. Besides, the team prioritizes software quality characteristics (attributes) in these DS projects to ensure some aspects of the final product's quality, i.e., functional correctness and robustness. To achieve those, they use regular accuracy metrics and include explainability and data leakage as quality metrics during training. Finally, the software engineer's role and its responsibilities differ from those of a traditional industry software engineer, as s/he is involved in most of the process steps.

Widely used frameworks (e.g., the cross-industry standard process for data mining) provide a standardized approach to data science but are limited in features such as role clarity, skills, and cross-team collaboration that are essential for developing organizational capabilities in data science. In this study, we introduce a data workflow method (DWM) as a new approach to break organizational silos and create a multi-disciplinary team to develop, implement and embed data science. Different from current data science process workflows, the DWM is managed at the system level that shapes business operating model for continuous improvement, rather than as a function of a particular project, one single business unit, or isolated individuals. To further operationalize the DWM approach, we investigated an embedded data workflow at a mining operation that has been using geological data in a machine-learning model to stabilize daily mill production for the last 2years. Based on the findings in this study, we propose that the DWM approach derives its capability from three aspects: (a) a systemic data workflow; (b) multi-disciplinary networks of collaboration and responsibility; and (c) clearly identified data roles and the associated skills and expertise.

A combination of metrics including number of electrons stored per molecule, redox potential, stability, and solubility of the charge carrier impact performance. In this context, we recently reported a 2,2′-bipyrimidine charge carrier that stores two electrons per molecule with reduction near −2.0 V vs. Fc/Fc+and high stability. However, these first-generation derivatives showed a modest solubility of 0.17 M (0.34 M e−). Seeking to improve solubility without sacrificing stability, we harnessed the synthetic modularity of this scaffold to design a library of sixteen candidates. Using computed molecular descriptors and a single node decision tree, we found that minimization of the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) can be used to predict derivatives with enhanced solubility. This parameter was used in combination with a heatmap describing stability to de-risk a virtual screen that ultimately identified a 2,2′-bipyrimidine with significantly increased solubility and good stability metrics in the reduced states.

Target safety assessments (TSAs) use target biology, gene and protein expression data, genetic information from humans and animals, and competitor compound intelligence to understand the potential safety risks associated with modulating a drug target. However, there is a vast amount of information, updated daily that must be considered for each TSA. We have developed a data science–based approach that allows acquisition of relevant evidence for an optimal TSA. This is built on expert-led conventional and artificial intelligence–based mining of literature and other bioinformatics databases. Potential safety risks are identified according to an evidence framework, adjusted to the degree of target novelty. Expert knowledge is necessary to interpret the evidence and to take account of the nuances of drug safety, the modality, and the intended patient population for each TSA within each project. Overall, TSAs take full advantage of the most recent developments in data science and can be used within drug projects to identify and mitigate risks, helping with informed decision-making and resource management. These approaches should be used in the earliest stages of a drug project to guide decisions such as target selection, discovery chemistry options, in vitro assay choice, and end points for investigative in vivo studies. © 2023 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.",Biochemistry,
724,A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide to Using Data Science Tools in the Gestion of Epidemiological and Climatological Data in Rice Production Systems,Rodríguez-Almonacid D.V.,Agronomy,2023-11-01,SCOPUS_ID:85178377780,1,True,2-s2.0-85178377780,Journal,"[{'name': 'Universidad Nacional de Colombia', 'city': 'Bogota', 'country': 'Colombia'}]",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85178377780&origin=inward,"The application of data science (DS) techniques has become increasingly essential in various fields, including epidemiology and climatology in agricultural production systems. In this sector, traditionally large amounts of data are acquired, but not well-managed and -analyzed as a basis for evidence-based decision-making processes. Here, we present a comprehensive step-by-step guide that explores the use of DS in managing epidemiological and climatological data within rice production systems under tropical conditions. Our work focuses on using the multi-temporal dataset associated with the monitoring of diseases and climate variables in rice in Colombia during eight years (2012–2019). The study comprises four main phases: (I) data cleaning and organization to ensure the integrity and consistency of the dataset; (II) data management involving web-scraping techniques to acquire climate information from free databases, like WordClim and Chelsa, validation against in situ weather stations, and bias removal to enrich the dataset; (III) data visualization techniques to effectively represent the gathered information, and (IV) a basic analysis related to the clustering and climatic characterization of rice-producing areas in Colombia. In our work, a process of evaluation and the validation of climate data are conducted based on errors (r, R2,MAE, RSME) and bias evaluation metrics. In addition, in phase II, climate clustering was conducted based on a PCA and K-means algorithm. Understanding the association of climatic and epidemiological data is pivotal in predicting and mitigating disease outbreaks in rice production areas. Our research underscores the significance of DS in managing epidemiological and climatological data for rice production systems. By applying a protocol responsible for DS tools, our study provides a solid foundation for further research into disease dynamics and climate interactions in rice-producing regions and other crops, ultimately contributing to more informed decision-making processes in agriculture. © 2023 by the authors.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,

The phase duration itself and its correlation with clinical parameters at diagnosis have not yet been investigated. Novel commercial platforms provide phase indications but have not been assessed for accuracy yet. (2) Methods: We assessed 100 robot-assisted partial nephrectomy videos for phase durations based on previously defined proficiency metrics. We developed an annotation framework and subsequently compared our annotations to an existing commercial solution (Touch Surgery, Medtronic™). We subsequently explored clinical correlations between phase durations and parameters derived from diagnosis and treatment. (3) Results: An objective and uniform phase assessment requires precise definitions derived from an iterative revision process. A comparison to a commercial solution shows large differences in definitions across phases. BMI and the duration of renal tumor identification are positively correlated, as are tumor complexity and both tumor excision and renorrhaphy duration. (4) Conclusions: The surgical phase duration can be correlated with certain clinical outcomes. Further research should investigate whether the retrieved correlations are also clinically meaningful. This requires an increase in dataset sizes and facilitation through intelligent computer vision algorithms. Commercial platforms can facilitate this dataset expansion and help unlock the full potential, provided that the phase annotation details are disclosed. © 2023 by the authors.",Biochemistry,

When firms are designing such competitions, a key question is “What should be a better contest design to motivate contestants to exert more effort?” We model two commonly observed contest structures (one stage and two stage) and two widely adopted prize structures (high spread and low spread). We employ economic experiments to examine how contest design affects contestants’ effort level. The results reject the base model with rationality assumption. We find that contestants exert significantly more effort in both the first stage and the second stage of the two-stage contest. Moreover, it is better to assign most prizes to the winner in the two-stage contest while it does not matter in one stage. To explain the empirical regularities, we develop a behavioral economics model that captures contestants’ psychological aversion to falling behind and continuous exertion of effort. Our findings demonstrate that it is important for contest organizers to account for the nonpecuniary factors that can influence contestants’ behavior in designing a competition. © 2023 Production and Operations Management Society.",Business,

At this time, however, many (developmental) psychological theories are insufficiently precise to derive testable hypotheses. This limits the advancement of our principled understanding of development. This problem cannot be resolved by improving the way deductive (confirmatory) research is conducted (e.g., through preregistration and replication), because theory formation requires inductive (exploratory) research. This paper argues that machine learning can help advance theory formation in (developmental) psychology, because it enables rigorous exploration of patterns in data. The paper discusses specific advantages of machine learning, explains core methodological concepts, introduces relevant methods, and describes how data-driven insights are consolidated into theory. Machine learning automates exploration, and incorporates checks and balances to ensure generalizable results. It can assist in phenomenon detection and offers a more holistic understanding of the phenomena associated with an outcome or process of interest. © 2022 The Author.

The latter sometimes requires traffic disruption, as well as higher time and cost-consumption activities, and the use of dedicated inspection vehicles is less economical and efficient as the use of in-service vehicles. Furthermore, the use of non-automated algorithms faces challenges when it comes to early damage detection in railway infrastructure, considering operational, environmental, and big data aspects, and may lead to false alarms. To overcome these challenges, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for early detection of track defects using accelerations, measured by dynamic monitoring systems in in-service railway vehicles is attracting the attention of railway managers. In this paper, an AI-based methodology based on axle box acceleration signals is applied for the early detection of distributed damage to track in terms of the longitudinal level and lateral alignment. The methodology relies on feature extraction using an autoregressive model, data normalization using principal component analysis, data fusion and feature discrimination using Mahalanobis distance and outlier analysis, considering eight onboard accelerometers. For the numerical simulations, 75 undamaged and 45 damaged track scenarios are considered. The alert limit state defined in the European Standard for assessing track geometry quality is also assumed as a threshold. It was found that the detection accuracy of the AI-based methodology for different sensor layouts and types of damage is greater than 94%, which is acceptable. © 2023 by the authors.",Engineering,

The severity of a geomagnetic storm is measured using the disturbance-storm-time (Dst) index. The Dst index is calculated by averaging the horizontal component of the magnetic field observed at four near-equatorial observatories and is used to drive geomagnetic disturbance models. As a key specification of the magnetospheric dynamics, the Dst index is used to drive geomagnetic disturbance models such as the High Definition Geomagnetic Model—Real Time. Since 1975, forecasting models have been proposed to forecast Dst solely from solar wind observations at the Lagrangian-1 position. However, while the recent Machine-Learning (ML) models generally perform better than other approaches, many are unsuitable for operational use. Recent exponential growth in data-science research and the democratization of ML tools have opened up the possibility of crowd-sourcing specific problem-solving tasks with clear constraints and evaluation metrics. To this end, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Centers for Environmental Information and the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences conducted an open data-science challenge called “MagNet: Model the Geomagnetic Field.” The challenge attracted 622 participants, resulting in 1,197 model submissions that used various ML approaches.

Constructed on top of Google JAX, a rising machine learning library focusing on high-performance numerical computing, JAX-FEM is implemented with pure Python while scalable to efficiently solve problems with moderate to large sizes. For example, in a 3D tensile loading problem with 7.7 million degrees of freedom, JAX-FEM with GPU achieves around 10× acceleration compared to a commercial FEM code depending on platform. Beyond efficiently solving forward problems, JAX-FEM employs the automatic differentiation technique so that inverse problems are solved in a fully automatic manner without the need to manually derive sensitivities. Examples of 3D topology optimization of nonlinear materials are shown to achieve optimal compliance. Finally, JAX-FEM is an integrated platform for machine learning-aided computational mechanics. We show an example of data-driven multi-scale computations of a composite material where JAX-FEM provides an all-in-one solution from microscopic data generation and model training to macroscopic FE computations. The source code of the library and these examples are shared with the community to facilitate computational mechanics research.

Instrumental developments in recent years have increased the quality and quantity of data available; however, using current data analysis methods, structures can be assigned to only a small fraction of compounds present in typical mixtures. We present a new data analysis pipeline, “MSEI”, that harnesses data science methodologies to improve structural identification capabilities from tandem mass spectrometry data. In particular, feature vectors for fingerprint calculation are found directly from tandem mass spectra, strongly reducing computational costs, and fingerprint comparison uses an optimised methodology accounting for uncertainty to improve distinction between matching and non-matching compounds. MSEI builds on the identification of a small number of compounds through current state-of-the-art data analysis on UHPLC-HRMS/MS measurements and uses targeted training and tailored molecular fingerprints to focus identification to a particular molecular space of interest. Initial compound identifications are used as training data for a set of random forests which directly predict a custom 75-digit molecular fingerprint from a vectorised MS/MS spectrum. Kendrick mass defects (KMDs) for peaks as well as “lost” fragments removed during fragmentation were found to be useful information for fingerprint prediction. Fingerprints are then compared to potential matches from the PubChem structural database using Euclidean distance, with fingerprint digit weights determined using an SVM to maximise distance between matching and non-matching compounds. Potential matches are additionally filtered for hydrophobicity based on measured retention time, using a newly developed machine learning method for retention time prediction. MSEI was able to correctly assign > 50% of structures in a test dataset and showed > 10% better performance than current state-of-the-art methods, while using an order of magnitude less computational power and a fraction of the training data. © 2023, The Author(s).",Chemistry,

Driven by the need for offshore wind to reduce costs while also minimising project risk, there is currently a strong focus within the offshore industry on identifying new ways to extract the full benefit from all available site investigation data and carry this benefit through to engineering design. This paper provides a demonstration of two such approaches that utilise geo-data from offshore Western Australia, potentially representative of conditions of future offshore wind farms; the first is an integrated approach combining geophysical and geotechnical data through a seismic inversion process, while the second encompasses statistical analysis of geotechnical cone penetrometer and soil strength test data combined with a Bayesian compressive sampling-based spatial interpolation method. The demonstrations yielded useful findings about the methodologies and associated input requirements.

Students gained proficiency after undertaking initial practice. Live coding sessions demonstrated the flexible instruction enabled by literate notebooks. Assignments and projects required documentation alongside functional code. Student feedback showed enthusiasm for learning a versatile IDE, despite some frustration with the learning curve. Skilled students highlighted efficiency gains in a unified environment. However, the uneven adoption of documentation practices pointed to a need for better incorporation into grading.

An engine failure excludes the ship from operation or significantly limits its operation. Therefore, accurate fault diagnosis should be a crucial issue for modern maintenance strategies. In mechanical engineering, the vibration and acoustic signals recorded during the operation of the device are the most meaningful data used to identify the reliability state. In this paper, a novel system-oriented method of reliability state identification is proposed. The method consists of the analysis of the vibration and noise signals collected on each of the engine cylinders using supervised machine learning. The main novelty of this method is data augmentation application and SVM classifier implementation. Due to these aspects, the method becomes robust in the case of poor-quality data or a limited and incomplete learning dataset. The quality of the proposed identification method was evaluated by addressing a new industrial issue (Sulzer 6AL20/24 marine engine reliability state identification). During the tests, the efficiency of the method was analyzed in the case of a complete learning data set (all types of inability states were presented in the learning data set) and an incomplete learning data set (in the testing data set, there were new types of inability states). As a result, in both cases, a very high (100%) identification accuracy of the reliability state and the type of inability state was obtained. This is a significant increase in accuracy (4.6% for the complete and 22% for the incomplete learning data set) in comparison to the efficiency of the same method without the use of machine learning and data science. © 2023 by the authors.",Computer Science,

Originally introduced in manufacturing, many attempts have been made to present proper definitions of this concept. Unfortunately, there remains a great deal of confusion surrounding the underlying concept, with many scientists still uncertain about the distinction between a simulation, a mathematical model and a DT. The aim of this paper is to propose a formal definition of a digital twin. To achieve this goal, we utilize a data science framework that facilitates a functional representation of a DT and other components that can be combined together to form a larger entity we refer to as a digital twin system (DTS). In our framework, a DT is an open dynamical system with an updating mechanism, also referred to as complex adaptive system (CAS). Its primary function is to generate data via simulations, ideally, indistinguishable from its physical counterpart. On the other hand, a DTS provides techniques for analyzing data and decision-making based on the generated data. Interestingly, we find that a DTS shares similarities to the principles of general systems theory. This multi-faceted view of a DTS explains its versatility in adapting to a wide range of problems in various application domains such as engineering, manufacturing, urban planning, and personalized medicine. © 2023 by the author.",Social Sciences,

It advances an approach that balances three aspects of RtS, namely, protection from harmful science, benefit-sharing and participation in science and derives three corresponding sets of state duties. First, RtS implies the duty to end data monetization in so far as it entails practices harmful to human rights, including unlawful interference with privacy. Second, while data monetization exists, RtS entails the duty to distribute monetary benefits through an RtS-based universal basic income (UBI). Third, RtS entails the duty to facilitate ordinary people's participation in DS and prioritize non-profit pro-social uses of DS as in citizen or community DS. The proposed RtS analysis of DS engages policy responses to artificial intelligence (AI) and material inequality, namely, AI regulation, monetary benefits from data, UBI and the 'data for good' movement.

From this perspective, data and analytics hold great promise and are necessary—but not sufficient—for improving strategic decision-making. Something more is needed to realize this potential. We specify how to fill this gap using an integration framework between technology and decision-makers, which is especially appropriate in complex and/or volatile environments. Our solution—which comprises a methodology as well as a software architecture—therefore unifies not only human decision makers to technology but each other and also integrates several disciplines that have been hitherto unnecessarily separated. Thereby, it could help organizations to address increasing challenges better as well as improve the exploration of possible futures. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Social Sciences,

In-house testing of blood, urine, and drug evidence from scenes was performed using equipment and supplies purchased for surveillance. Collaboration with state laboratories allowed validation. Applied forensic epidemiology accelerated data dissemination. From 2010 to 2022, the epidemic claimed 5815 lives in King County; the last 4 years accounted for 47% of those deaths. After initiating the surveillance project, in-house testing was performed on blood from 2836 decedents, urine from 2807, and 4238 drug evidence items from 1775 death scenes. Time to complete death certificates decreased from weeks to months to hours to days. Overdose-specific information was distributed weekly to a network of law enforcement and public health agencies. As the surveillance project tracked the epidemic, fentanyl and methamphetamine became dominant and were associated with other indicators of social deterioration. In 2022, fentanyl was involved in 68% of 1021 overdose deaths. Homeless deaths increased sixfold; in 2022, 67% of 311 homeless deaths were due to overdose; fentanyl was involved in 49% and methamphetamine in 44%. Homicides increased 250%; in 2021, methamphetamine was positive in 35% of 149 homicides.

The majority of virus-infected persons have mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover on their own. However, some people get serious ailments and need medical attention. Covid-19 can potentially make anyone seriously ill or cause passing away at any age. Nowadays, medical science is based on data science technology to achieve new milestones in genetics, genomics, patient-customer assistance, clinical imaging, drug discovery, and predictive medicine. It has gained due to Covid-19. This paper proposes a novel method: Extended and Compressed Convolution Hybrid Leader-based Optimization (ECCHLO) to differentiate between Covid-19 infected persons and healthy individuals. This outline involves four steps. The initial step is preprocessing the X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan images gathered from the datasets. In the second step, feature extraction is performed. Next, feature fusion is performed to eliminate redundant and unnecessary data. Finally, the Extended Hybrid Leader-Based Optimization (EHLBO) algorithm is utilized to tune the parameters of compressed convolutional neural networks. The ECCHLO model is examined and tested on four datasets, namely SARS-COV-2, Covid-19 radiography database, Covid-CT, and Covid-19 Image datasets. The accuracy of these four datasets is 99.6%, 99.5%, 99.3%, and 100%, respectively, which are higher than the other techniques. This demonstrates that the ECCHLO model is reliable and stable for identifying a person infected with Covid-19. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence and Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Computer Science,

Differences in individual plasticity may explain why therapies, such as psychotherapeutic and environmental interventions, are highly effective in some but not in all patients. Here I propose a mathematical formula to assess plasticity – i.e., the susceptibility to change – to identify, at baseline, which individuals or populations are more likely to modify their behavioral outcome according to therapies or contextual factors. The formula is grounded in the network theory of plasticity so that, when representing a system (e.g., a patient's psychopathology) as a weighed network where the nodes are the system features (e.g., symptoms) and the edges are the connections (i.e., correlations) among them, the network connectivity strength is an inverse measure of the plasticity of the system: the weaker the connectivity, the higher the plasticity and the greater the susceptibility to change. The formula is predicted to be generalizable, measuring plasticity at multiple scales, from the single cell to the whole brain, and can be applied to a wide range of research fields, including neuroscience, psychiatry, ecology, sociology, physics, market and finance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Neuroscience,

Accurate, predictive, and interpretable thermodynamic models for HFC/IL mixtures are essential for multiscale design schemes aiding this phaseout. Still, there is limited guidance regarding the best thermodynamic model for an HFC/IL system. We propose a rigorous thermodynamic model selection and analysis workflow for HFC/IL mixtures which harnesses data science tools – visualization, nonlinear regression, Akaike information criteria, Fischer information matrix (FIM)-based identifiability and uncertainty analyses, and model-based design of experiments methods – to evaluate the accuracy, predictive capability, and interpretability of a thermodynamic model. The open-source IDAES™ platform facilitates training and comparison of sixteen candidate HFC/IL thermodynamic models, including two cubic equations of state, Peng–Robinson and Soave–Redlich–Kwong, and eight variations on temperature dependence within a classical van der Waals mixing rule. We apply this analysis to models for three HFC/IL systems: HFC-32/[emim][TF2N], HFC-125/[emim][TF2N], and HFC-32/[bmim][PF6]. For these mixtures, we observe that models with a temperature dependent mixing rule are consistently ranked higher by Akaike information criteria for model selection. However, these models may still have high parameter uncertainty and correlation, indicating that data at multiple temperatures should be obtained. This result differs from the current practice of generating single isotherm dataset for most new HFC/IL mixtures. Additionally, we find that the most valuable experiments are taken at the bounds of composition, temperature (e.g., 273 and 348 K), and pressure (e.g., 1 MPa) measurements. This analysis guides data generation efforts, showing that optimally selected measurements across multiple temperatures are adequate for regressing thermodynamic models for multiscale process design. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Chemical Engineering,

One of this technology's main challenges is scheduling tasks and allocating resources to achieve the best performance with minimal optimized execution time, and less resource time and usage. Thus, the importance of task priority has been recognized by many researchers since tasks submitted to the cloud can have various sizes, resource utilization, and execution times. Therefore, existing task scheduling algorithms prioritize tasks, where the task with the highest priority is allocated to the available resource. This paper investigated the task priority problem in cloud-based Task Scheduling (TS) algorithms via three different directions centered around the following contributions; first, a fruitful discussion and comparison of some selected cloud priority-based TS algorithms regarding their scheduling method and parameters, algorithm performance, and limitations reflecting how the priority issue is handled in the cloud environment. In the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence age, the interaction and intervention between the Big Data sector and CC are gradually advancing due to mutual development. Cloud environments have become a prominent platform for big data applications, forcing the integration between Data Science and CC techniques to evolve. On this basis, secondly, the paper addresses the directions of potential future research of cloud priority-based TS schemes in Data Science.

Like many neurological disorder phenotypes, the diagnostic features are observable, can be tracked over time, and can be managed or even eliminated through proper therapy and treatments. However, there are major bottlenecks in the diagnostic, therapeutic, and longitudinal tracking pipelines for autism and related neurodevelopmental delays, creating an opportunity for novel data science solutions to augment and transform existing workflows and provide increased access to services for affected families. Several efforts previously conducted by a multitude of research labs have spawned great progress toward improved digital diagnostics and digital therapies for children with autism. We review the literature on digital health methods for autism behavior quantification and beneficial therapies using data science. We describe both case-control studies and classification systems for digital phenotyping. We then discuss digital diagnostics and therapeutics that integrate machine learning models of autism-related behaviors, including the factors that must be addressed for translational use. Finally, we describe ongoing challenges and potential opportunities for the field of autism data science. Given the heterogeneous nature of autism and the complexities of the relevant behaviors, this review contains insights that are relevant to neurological behavior analysis and digital psychiatry more broadly. © 2023 Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science.

Epidemic diseases have lower transmission rate than pandemic diseases and they spread in a bounded area. On the other hand, pandemic diseases have higher transmission rate and it can easily spread in an immense area. We can control this type of disease in its initial stages before it becomes a fatal disease like covid-19. Lack of knowledge in peoples and inefficient systems used by higher authorities in that region are the main reasons to spread diseases in larger areas. But using data science and the epidemic compartment models it’s possible to control infectious diseases in its initial stages. For different diseases there are different compartment algorithms that are able to estimate the number of cases in the future. These models often use ordinary differential equations for predicting things.

However, these systems should achieve continuous data processing and adapt their behavior to changes arising in real scenarios. Nevertheless, building this type of self-adaptable systems is not trivial, as it requires integrating data analytics and artificial intelligence with cloud computing tools and security and fault tolerance applications. This produces delays in the processing of data, affecting the information delivery in decision-making processes. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a method to build self-adaptable data science services by using dynamic patterns. This method includes two models: a construction model and a coupling model. The construction model is based on dynamic parallel patterns to create, at design time, in-memory processing structures including as many applications as needed to meet the non-functional requirements (NFRs), such as security and fault tolerance, established by healthcare organizations without affecting the efficiency of a data science system. In turn, the coupling model converts the in-memory processing structures into software blocks that are coupled with the I/O interfaces of data science systems to support the automatic and transparent continuous management of data for facing changes in the incoming workload during execution time. A prototype was implemented to create self-adaptable health data science systems including in-memory processing structures for managing spirometry studies, tomography images, and electrocardiograms. The performance evaluation showed that the dynamic patterns significantly reduced the response time required to prepare contents with NFR characteristics in comparison with solutions from the state-of-the-art such as Nextflow and Makeflow. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Computer Science,

However, the bridge from research to practice can be fraught with sociopolitical frictions that impede, or altogether block, such translations-especially when they are contentious or otherwise difficult to achieve. Focusing on one entrenched educational equity issue in US public schools-racial and ethnic segregation-we conduct randomized email outreach experiments and surveys to explore how local school districts respond to algorithmically-generated school catchment areas (""attendance boundaries"") designed to foster more diverse and integrated schools. Cold email outreach to approximately 4,320 elected school board members across over 800 school districts informing them of potential boundary changes reveals a large average open rate of nearly 40%, but a relatively small click-through rate of 2.5% to an interactive dashboard depicting such changes. Board members, however, appear responsive to different messaging techniques - -particularly those that dovetail issues of racial and ethnic diversity with other top-of-mind issues (like school capacity planning). On the other hand, media coverage of the research drives more dashboard engagement, especially in more segregated districts. A small but rich set of survey responses from school board and community members across several districts identify data and operational bottlenecks to implementing boundary changes to foster more diverse schools, but also share affirmative comments on the potential viability of such changes. Together, our findings may support educational data scientists in more effectively disseminating research that aims to bridge educational inequalities through systems-level change. © 2023 ACM.",Computer Science,

Quantitative 2-D analyses of pore sizes can be extracted from SEM, but without information about 3-D spatial arrangement and connectivity, which are crucial to the understanding of membrane pore structure. Meanwhile, experimental 3-D reconstruction via tomography is complex, expensive, and not easily accessible. Here, we employ data science tools to demonstrate a proof-of-principle reconstruction of the 3-D structure of a membrane using a single 2-D image pulled from a 3-D tomographic data set. The reconstructed and experimental 3-D structures were then directly compared, with important properties such as mean pore radius, mean throat radius, coordination number and tortuosity differing by less than 15%. The developed algorithm could dramatically improve the ability of the membrane community to characterize membranes, accelerating the design and synthesis of membranes with desired structural and transport properties. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Biochemistry,

Numerous ransomware prediction strategies have been published, but more practical machine learning ransomware prediction techniques still need to be developed. In order to anticipate ransomware assaults, this study provides a method for obtaining data from artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. A more accurate model for outcome prediction is produced by using the data science methodology. Understanding the data and identifying the variables are essential elements of a successful model. A variety of machine learning algorithms are applied to the pre-processed data, and the accuracy of each technique is compared to determine which approach performed better. Additional performance indicators including recall, accuracy, and f1-score are also taken into account while evaluating the model.

These platforms have been widely critiqued for their exploitative labour relations, and over recent years, there have been various efforts by academic researchers to develop interventions aimed at improving labour conditions. The aim of this paper is to explore US-based crowdworkers’ views on two proposed interventions: a browser plugin that detects automated quality control “Gold Question” (GQ) checks and a proposal for a crowdworker co-operative. Design/methodology/approach: The authors interviewed 20 US-based crowdworkers and undertook a thematic analysis of collected data. Findings: The findings indicate that US-based crowdworkers tend to have negative and mixed feelings about the GQ detector, but were more enthusiastic about the crowdworker co-operative. Originality/value: Drawing on theories of precarious labour, this study suggests an explanation for the findings based on US-based workers’ objective and subjective experiences of precarity. The authors argue that for US-based crowdworkers “constructive” interventions such as a crowdworker co-operative have more potential to improve labour conditions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Social Sciences,

Alongside this, ‘intersectionality’ has increased in prominence as a critical social theory and praxis to address inequalities. Yet, there is not a comprehensive review of how intersectionality is operationalized in research data practice. In this study, we examined how intersectionality researchers across a range of disciplines conduct intersectional analysis as a means of unpacking how intersectional praxis may advance an intersectional data science agenda. To explore how intersectionality researchers collect and analyze data, we conducted a critical discourse analysis approach in a review of 172 articles that stated using an intersectional approach in some way. We contemplated whether and how Collins’ three frames of relationality were evident in their approach. We found an over-reliance on the additive thinking frame in quantitative research, which poses limits on the potential for this research to address structural inequality. We suggest ways in which intersectional data science could adopt an articulation mindset to improve on this tendency. © The Author(s) 2023.",Computer Science,

With increasing numbers of campaigns, numbers of sensors and campaign time, the volume and heterogeneity of the data, ranging from simple temperature time series to series of HD images or video call for new data science approaches to analyze the data. While some works have been published on the analysis of data from one campaign, we address the problem of analyzing time series data from two consecutive monitoring campaigns (starting late 2017 and late 2018) in the same habitat. While the data from campaigns in two separate years provide an interesting basis for marine biology research, it also presents new data science challenges, like the the marine image analysis in data form more than one campaign. In this paper, we analyze the polyp activity of two Paragorgia arborea cold water coral (CWC) colonies using FUO data collected from November 2017 to June 2018 and from December 2018 to April 2019. We successfully apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the segmentation and classification of the coral and the polyp activities. The result polyp activity data alone showed interesting temporal patterns with differences and similarities between the two time periods. A one month “sleeping” period in spring with almost no activity was observed in both coral colonies, but with a shift of approximately one month. A time series prediction experiment allowed us to predict the polyp activity from the non-image sensor data using recurrent neural networks (RNN). The results pave a way to a new multi-sensor monitoring strategy for Paragorgia arborea behaviour. © 2023 van Kevelaer et al.

Engaging students in Knowledge Building (KB) may be a promising way to respond to this challenge because it requires students to reflect on and direct their inquiry with the support of data. Informed by previous studies, this research explored how an analytics-supported reflective assessment (AsRA)-enhanced KB design influenced 6th graders' KB and data science practices in a science education setting. One intact class with 56 students participated in this study. The analysis of students' Knowledge Forum discourse showed the positive influences of the AsRA-enhanced KB design on students' development of KB and data science practices. Further analysis of different-performing groups revealed that the AsRA-enhanced KB design was accessible to all performing groups. These findings have important implications for teachers and researchers who aim to develop students' KB and data science practices, and general high-level collaborative inquiry skills.

Statistics departments have traditionally offered data science courses for a long time. The main objective of these courses is to examine the fundamental concepts and theories. However, teaching data science courses has also expanded to other disciplines due to the vast amount of data being collected by numerous modern applications. Also, someone needs to learn how to collect and process data, especially from industrial devices, because of the recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Hence, integrating data science into the curricula of different engineering branches becomes a matter of relating the statistics background to the specific discipline. There are several reasons for this transition. Firstly, as the increased computational power and massive availability of the data make the use of statistical theories possible in more engineering applications, there is a growing need for engineering students to build knowledge in data science concepts. Secondly, the wide availability of libraries and models allows for the implementation of diverse solutions to engineering problems.

Machine Learning (ML) research aims at making a program 'learn,' that is, develop models and techniques with known information to be able to handle future problems. Traditionally, this is done by increasing the quantity and quality of input data and training the learner in more effective ways to interpret that information. This has a direct parallel to the collegiate classroom, as instructors aim to inspire mastery over a topic to their students through a variety of methods (homework problems, examinations, projects, etc.) and teach them the corresponding skillsets from feedback on these assignments. Machine Teaching (MT) research, on the other hand, aims at making the teacher more productive by using their own cognitive models to improve the quality of the data holistically. Again, this has a corresponding counterpart to current teaching pedagogies; the instructor decides on the details of an assignment from their own knowledge and experience with the end goal of having students retain the information and apply it to future problems.

To fill this gap, we have developed a project-based technical elective course “Machine Learning for Mechanical Engineers” and offered it to undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Arkansas. While this course is received very well by the students and has led to fruitful presentations and publications, it has a low enrollment volume from undergraduate students due to its relatively high programming requirements. A more sophisticated strategy is required to equip mechanical engineering students with data science skills without disturbing the existing curriculum. Inspired by the success of computer-aided design education at the University of Arkansas and the Data Science InFusion into Undergraduate STEM Education (DIFUSE) program at Dartmouth College, we have developed course-specific machine learning modules to be integrated into mechanical engineering core courses rather than dedicated data science courses. This effort includes a nonparametric regression module for Computer Methods in Mechanical Engineering, a generative design module for Computer-Aided Design, and a genetic algorithms module for Thermal Systems Analysis and Design, among others. Through this practice, students will practice programming and machine learning skills every semester from their sophomore year and will be ready for the project-based technical elective machine learning course. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",Computer Science,

Given the rapid adoption of data analytics in engineering and the societal importance of many of its applications, there is an urgent need to train the next generation of civil engineers in data science. Several studies have emphasized that the use of data science in the present civil engineering undergraduate curricula is mostly restricted to simple introductory subjects, usually with the use of Microsoft Excel. The curriculum does not encourage students to fully benefit from big data since data science is not extensively used. Additionally, there is a lack of clear guidance on how to strengthen the synergy between common civil engineering courses and data science. In this paper, the authors report on a recently introduced course entitled “Data Science and Engineering Systems Analysis,” at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU), incorporating the integration of R programming into data analytics, and systems thinking for the analysis and design of civil engineering applications. The course aims at empowering students with the necessary tools to apply statistics in a civil engineering context, and perform data transformation, data wrangling, visualization, and modeling using R for data science. Students learn how to gather and analyze data as part of the engineering design process, apply systems thinking to an engineering or societal phenomenon, collaborate with peers to find solutions, and effectively present solutions to an audience. Through a careful examination of the course's key features, its applications, and its synergy with the existing curriculum, this paper provides guidance for data science curriculum development, implementation, and evaluation in civil engineering. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",Computer Science,

To bridge a critical gap in the contemporary literature on how to improve satellite-based PM2.5estimation models, we have systematically reviewed global efforts at PM2.5estimation between 2000 and 2020 using big data analytics, focusing on a critical evaluation of PM2.5modeling accuracy improvements in response to varying methods and covariates, mainly from remote sensing and data science perspectives. Using an automated literature classification deep learning method, we identified 833 publications with fair inter-comparisons among relevant PM2.5estimation models. The inter-compared modeling accuracy metrics were then retrieved and aggregated with respect to each modeling factor to form a global research synthesis database. The synthesized results highlighted that greater PM2.5modeling accuracy (i.e., a mean R2improvement by 6.2%) can be attained by incorporating aerosol optical depth (AOD); this benefit could even be doubled by applying fine-mode AOD. Further enhancements could be achieved by conducting vertical and humidity corrections to AOD (10.41%), as well as including relevant meteorological and socioeconomic factors that are highly associated with PM2.5variations (12%, on average). By contrast, improving spatial resolution of satellite AOD products and temporal resolution of ground PM2.5measurements are unlikely to yield better PM2.5estimation accuracy (improvement of 1.2%). Although advanced machine learning algorithms with better generalization capacity is more cost-effective, the accuracy improvements vary substantially across studies, largely depending on data sources, study regions, and even seasons. The statistical findings underscore the critical importance of domain knowledge and advancements in remote sensing and data science for improving PM2.5modeling accuracy.

The heterogeneity of the data and its overwhelming magnitude have made it impossible to perform manual analysis. As a consequence, new techniques have been developed and different strategies have been amalgamated, such as data science and data mining, in order to carry out more in-depth and exhaustive analyses in search of the extraction of the knowledge contained in data. This paper introduces a data science methodology that consists of successive stages, with the core of this proposal being the step of data preprocessing, with the aim of reducing the complexity of the analysis and enabling hidden knowledge in the data to be uncovered. The proposed methodology was tested on a set of data consisting of artificial light curves that try to mimic the behaviour of the strong gravitational lens phenomenon, as supplied by the Time Delay Challenge 1 (TDC1). Under the data science methodology, diverse statistical methods were implemented for data analysis, and cross-correlation and dispersion methods were applied for the time-delay estimation of strong lensing systems. With this methodology, we obtained time-delay estimations from the TDC1 data set and compared them with earlier results reported by the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses project (COSMOGRAIL). The empirical evidence leads us to conclude that, with the proposed methodology, we achieve a greater accuracy in estimating time delays compared with estimations made with raw data. © 2023 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.",Physics and Astronomy,

Computational training for ecological and evolutionary sciences has become more abundant and accessible over the past decade, but tool development has outpaced the availability of specialized training. Most training for scripted analyses focuses on individual analysis steps in one script rather than creating a scripted pipeline, where modular functions comprise an ecosystem of interdependent steps. Although current computational training creates an excellent starting place, linear styles of scripting can risk becoming labor- and time-intensive and less reproducible by often requiring manual execution. Pipelines, however, can be easily automated or tracked by software to increase efficiency and reduce potential errors. Ecology and evolution would benefit from techniques that reduce these risks by managing analytical pipelines in a modular, readily parallelizable format with clear documentation of dependencies. Workflow management software (WMS) can aid in the reproducibility, intelligibility and computational efficiency of complex pipelines. To date, WMS adoption in ecology and evolutionary research has been slow. We discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing WMS and illustrate its use through a case study with the targets r package to further highlight WMS benefits through workflow automation, dependency tracking and improved clarity for reviewers. Although WMS requires familiarity with function-oriented programming and careful planning for more advanced applications and pipeline sharing, investment in training will enable access to the benefits of WMS and impart transferable computing skills that can facilitate ecological and evolutionary data science at large scales. © 2023 The Authors.

The paper discusses how ChatGPT can assist data scientists in automating various aspects of their workflow, including data cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation. It also highlights how ChatGPT has the potential to provide new insights and improve decision-making processes by analyzing unstructured data. We then examine the advantages of ChatGPT’s architecture, including its ability to be fine-tuned for a wide range of language-related tasks and generate synthetic data.

Its evolution and education have taken many sharp turns. We present an impressionistic study of the evolution of DS anchored to Kuhn's four stages of paradigm shifts. First, we construct the landscape of DS based on curriculum analysis of the 32 iSchools across the world offering graduate-level DS programs. Second, we paint the “field” as it emerges from the word frequency patterns, ranking, and clustering of course titles based on text mining. Third, we map the curriculum to the landscape of DS and project the same onto the Edison Data Science Framework (2017) and ACM Data Science Knowledge Areas (2021). Our study shows that the DS programs of iSchools align well with the field and correspond to the Knowledge Areas and skillsets. iSchool's DS curriculums exhibit a bias toward “data visualization” along with machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence; go light on statistics; slanted toward ontologies and health informatics; and surprisingly minimal thrust toward eScience/research data management, which we believe would add a distinctive iSchool flavor to the DS. © 2022 Association for Information Science and Technology.",Computer Science,

Advanced data acquisition and data science generally require expensive precision instrumentation and massive computation, often out-of-reach even for upper-level undergraduate laboratory courses. At the same time, a new generation of affordable do-it-yourself instruments presents an opportunity for incorporation of curricula focused on instrument design and computation into freshman-level courses. We present a new lab for integration into existing courses that starts with hands-on spectrometer building, moves to data collection, and finally introduces an advanced data science technique, singular value decomposition, at an appropriate level with minimal computing requirements. The hardware and software used are modular and inexpensive. The lab was tested in three community college general chemistry sections over two semesters. Previously, students taking these courses did not typically see advanced quantitative chemistry curricula before deciding whether to pursue a bachelor’s degree. This lab allowed students to practice data collection and organization skills, use prewritten Jupyter notebooks that perform advanced data analysis, and gain presentation skills.

By understanding the failure characteristics of the hardware components, data scientists can develop strategies to mitigate the impact of failures on their computations, and design systems that are more fault-tolerant and resilient. In particular, failure time modeling allows data scientists to predict the likelihood and frequency of hardware failures, which can help inform decisions about system design and resource allocation. In this paper, we aimed to model the failure times of processors and memories of computers; this was performed by formulating a new type of bivariate model using the copula function. The modified extended exponential distribution is the suggested lifetime of the experimental units. It was shown that the new bivariate model has many important properties, which are presented in this work. The inferential statistics for the distribution parameters were obtained under the assumption of a Type-II censored sampling scheme. Therefore, point and interval estimation were observed using the maximum likelihood and the Bayesian estimation methods. Additionally, bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated. Numerical analysis via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was performed. Finally, a real data example of processors and memories failure time was examined and the efficiency of the new bivariate distribution of fitting the data sample was observed by comparing it with other bivariate models. © 2023 by the authors.",Mathematics,

Accumulated PAP data provide valuable and objective information regarding patient treatment adherence and efficiency. However, the majority of studies that have analyzed longitudinal PAP remote monitoring have summarized data trajectories in static and simplistic metrics for PAP adherence and the residual apnea-hypopnea index by the use of mean or median values. The aims of this article are to suggest directions for improving data cleaning and processing and to address major concerns for the following data science applications: (1) conditions for residual apnea-hypopnea index reliability, (2) lack of standardization of indicators provided by different PAP models, (3) missing values, and (4) consideration of treatment interruptions. To allow fair comparison among studies and to avoid biases in computation, PAP data processing and management should be conducted rigorously with these points in mind.

Classifying levels of executive functions using resting state EEG and data science methods,Zazon D.,Decision Support Systems,2023-05-01,SCOPUS_ID:85147714803,6,False,2-s2.0-85147714803,Journal,"[{'name': 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev', 'city': 'Beer-Sheva', 'country': 'Israel'}]",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147714803&origin=inward,"Based on the assumption that the success of an organization is largely determined by the knowledge and skills of its employees, human resource (HR) departments invest considerable resources in the employee recruitment process with the aim of selecting the best, most suitable employees. Due to the high cost of the recruitment process along with its high rate of uncertainty, HR recruiters utilize a variety of methods and instruments to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of this process. Thus far, however, neurological methods, in which neurobiological signals from an examined person are analyzed, have not been utilized for this purpose. This study is the first to propose a neuro-based decision support system to classify cognitive functions into levels, whose target is to enrich the information and indications regarding the candidate along the employee recruitment processes. We first measured relevant functional and cognitive abilities of 142 adult participants using traditional computer-based assessment, which included a battery of four tests regarding executive functions and intelligence score, consistent with actual recruitment processes. Second, using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, which is one of the dominant measurement tools in NeuroIS research, we collected the participants' brain signals by administering a resting state EEG (rsEEG) on each participant. Finally, using advanced machine and deep learning algorithms, we leveraged the collected rsEEG to classify participants' levels of executive functions and intelligence score. Our empirical analyses show encouraging results of up to 72.6% accuracy for the executive functions and up to 71.2% accuracy for the intelligence score. Therefore, this study lays the groundwork for a novel, generic (non-stimuli based) system that supports the current employee recruitment processes, that is based on psychological theories of assessing executive functions. The proposed decision support system could contribute to the development of additional medium of assessing employees remotely which is especially relevant in the current Covid-19 pandemic. While our method aims at classification rather than at explanation, our intriguing findings have the potential to push forward NeuroIS research and practice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Computer Science,

Their goal is to invest this information using data analysis methods in order to better understand the trends of certain events. This could help them enhance the management of their allocated resources, which leads to a reduction in the operational costs, increase in efficiency and the overall intervention speed. Therefore, in this research paper, we investigate the possibility of predicting future incidents using machine learning algorithms that are trained on a set of data containing information on almost 200,000 interventions that happened during the last 6 years. These data, provided by the fire department in the region of Doubs, France, were not sufficient to detect patterns. Thus, we have imported additional information from external resources that we thought it would improve the accuracy of the predictions.

Data science is useful for analysis (pattern recognition, hypothesis testing, risk valuation) and prediction. The major, primary usage of data science in the healthcare domain is in medical imaging. At the same time, lung cancer diagnosis has become a hot research topic, as automated disease detection poses numerous benefits. Although numerous approaches have existed in the literature for lung cancer diagnosis, the design of a novel model to automatically identify lung cancer is a challenging task. In this view, this paper designs an automated machine learning (ML) with data science-enabled lung cancer diagnosis and classification (MLDS-LCDC) using computed tomography (CT) images. The presented model initially employs Gaussian filtering (GF)-based pre-processing technique on the CT images collected from the lung cancer database. Besides, they are fed into the normalized cuts (Ncuts) technique where the nodule in the pre-processed image can be determined. Moreover, the oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) technique is applied as a feature extractor. At last, sunflower optimization-based wavelet neural network (SFO-WNN) model is employed for the classification of lung cancer. In order to examine the diagnostic outcome of the MLDS-LCDC model, a set of experiments were carried out and the results are investigated in terms of different aspects. The resultant values demonstrated the effectiveness of the MLDS-LCDC model over the other state-of-The-Art methods with the maximum sensitivity of 97.01%, specificity of 98.64%, and accuracy of 98.11%. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Computer Science,

Concomitant with this ever-increasing appetite for data science is an expanding catalogue of challenges associated with developing, deploying, and maintaining data science software: choosing the appropriate, if any, analytical technique to use; balancing competing conceptions of success; and sustaining user adoption. In my thesis, I argue that these are sociotechnical challenges: issues that arise in the tension between what people do, and how data science software supports, limits, and, crucially, changes what they do. Through design science research, this thesis will develop, demonstrate, and evaluate a design approach for data science software that attempts to address such sociotechnical challenges. The empirical sites in which these research activities will take place are live data science projects with local government organisations responsible for adult social care services in England. The resultant approach will include a conceptual model for sociotechnical data science, process guidance and methods for applying the design approach, and results from applying the approach in a real-world data science project in collaboration with an industry partner. © 2023 Owner/Author.",Computer Science,

While programmable and interactive interfaces such as widgets embedded within computational notebooks are suitable for these workflows, they lack robust state management capabilities and do not support user-defined customization of the interactive components. The absence of such capabilities hinders workflow reusability and transparency while limiting the scope of exploration of the end-users. In response, we developed Magneton, a framework for authoring interactive widgets within computational notebooks that enables transparent, reusable, and customizable data science workflows. The framework enhances existing widgets to support fine-grained interaction history management, reusable states, and user-defined customizations. We conducted three case studies in a real-world knowledge graph construction and serving platform to evaluate the effectiveness of these widgets. Based on the observations, we discuss future implications of employing Magneton widgets for general-purpose data science workflows. © 2023 Owner/Author.",Computer Science,

While recent scholarship in artificial intelligence and machine learning has focused on limiting and eliminating error, practitioners have long used error as a site of collaboration and learning vis-à-vis labelers, domain experts, and the worlds data scientists seek to model and understand. Drawing from work in CSCW, STS, HCML, and repair studies, as well as from multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork within a government institution and a non-profit organization, we move beyond the notion of error as an edge case or anomaly to make three basic arguments. First, error discloses or calls to attention existing structures of collaboration unseen or underappreciated under 'working' systems. Second, error calls into being new forms and sites of collaboration (including, sometimes, new actors). Third, error redeploys old sites and actors in new ways, often through restructuring relations of hierarchy and expertise which recenter or devalue the position of different actors. We conclude by discussing how an artful living with error can better support the creative strategies of negotiation and adjustment which data scientists and their collaborators engage in when faced with disruption, breakdown, and friction in their work. © 2023 ACM.",Computer Science,

In specific, an accurate modeling of material behavior to predict the mechanical performance of a thermoplastic part is an evolving subject in this field as one needs to consider multiple factors and steps to achieve the right prediction accuracies. The variability in prediction comes from different factors such as polymer type (filled vs. unfilled, amorphous vs semi crystalline etc.), design and manufacturing features (weldline, gate locations, thickness, notches etc.), operating conditions (temperature, moisture etc.) and finally load states (tension, compression, flexural, impact etc.). Using traditional numerical simulation-based modelling to study and validate all these factors requires significant computational time and effort. An alternative method by using data science and AI-ML models is proposed to reduce the overall validation time needed for simulation. To validate this methodology, extensive part level experiments were done on a representative cylindrical geometry to accommodate all these factors using different ULTEM™ Resin materials (PEI). The results show that by using neural network ML model, it is possible to accurately predict the structural response like maximum displacement and force. The ML model results were compared to the CAE based approaches and results overlapped with each other well within the 95% scatter band. By combining both the CAE modelling and ML modelling it is possible to accurately predict the critical structural response of applications more efficiently and economically. © 2023 SAE International.

This study seeks to identify the most significant factors that positively and negatively affect life expectancy, separating them from less significant factors. This way, specific areas can be identified to channel scarce economic resources towards increasing life expectancy. Using data science techniques on a dataset comprising economic, immunological, health, personal, and social attributes, we have been able to achieve this. Furthermore, four machine learning tree regression algorithms were employed using the identified attributes to develop and evaluate life expectancy prediction models. The extremely randomized tree model performed best using evaluation matrices: MAE, RMSE, R2, and CV score. This research can help governments, especially in low-income, developing countries, make better decisions and investments, as well as help digital health experts develop technologies that could improve life expectancy. © 2023 The Author(s)",Computer Science,

Additionally, data scientists have become ubiquitous in the private market and academic environments. All of these trends are on a steady rise, and are associated with an increase in power consumption and associated carbon footprint. The increasing carbon footprint of large-scale advanced data science has already received attention, but the latter trend has not. This work aims to estimate the contribution of the increasingly popular “common” data science to the global carbon footprint. To this end, the power consumption of several typical tasks in the aforementioned common data science tasks are measured and compared to: large-scale “advanced” data science, common computer-related tasks, and everyday non-computer related tasks. An automated data science project is also run on various hardware architectures. To assess its sustainability in terms of carbon emission, the measurements are converted to gCO2eq and an equivalent unit of “km driven by car”. Our main findings are: “common” data science consumes 2.57 more power than regular computer usage, but less than some common everyday power-consuming tasks such as lighting or heating; advanced data science consumes substantially more power than common data science, and can be either on par or vastly surpass common everyday power-consuming tasks, depending on the scale of the project. In addition to the reporting of these results, this work also aims to inspire researchers to include power usage and estimated carbon emission as a secondary result in their work. © 2023",Computer Science,

Challenges in operating computing underwater combined with a lack of high-speed communication technology covering most aquatic areas means that there is a significant delay between the collection and analysis of data. This in turn limits the scale and complexity of the applications that can operate based on these data. In this article, we develop underwater fog computing support using low-cost micro-clouds and demonstrate how they can be used to deliver cost-effective support for data-heavy underwater applications. We develop a proof-of-concept micro-cloud prototype and use it to perform extensive benchmarks that evaluate the suitability of underwater micro-clouds for diverse underwater data science scenarios. We conduct rigorous tests in both controlled and field deployments, using river and sea waters. We also address technical challenges in enabling underwater fogs, evaluating the performance of different communication interfaces and demonstrating how accelerometers can be used to detect the likelihood of communication failures and determine which communication interface to use. Our work offers a cost-effective way to increase the scale and complexity of underwater data science applications, and demonstrates how off-the-shelf devices can be adopted for this purpose. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Computer Science,

DSA serves multiple purposes in that regard: it teaches teachers, it gives undergraduates mentoring experience, and it provides a platform for educational research and development. Currently, the DSA comprises five teaching modules, which have been repackaged and delivered as quarter or semester long weekend sessions, or shorter intensive summer programs. That is to say, the DSA accommodates flexible formats, including virtual or in-person ones and soon asynchronous options as well. The DSA provides an opportunity to develop and test lesson modules, including those derived from research projects in partnership with DS-PATH participants (an NSF project to create DS Pathways).

Moreover, it shows that data science methodologies can accurately predict graduate outcomes. The dataset used to analyze graduate outcomes was derived from a private educational institution survey. The original dataset contains information on 17,898 graduates and approximately 148 features. Three machine learning algorithms, namely, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting, were used for data analysis. These three machine learning models were compared with ordinal regression. The results indicate that gradient boosting is the best predictive model, which is 6% higher than the ordinal regression accuracy. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a novel methodology to extract the significant features of different machine learning algorithms, was then used to extract the most important features of the gradient boosting model. Current salary is the most important feature in predicting job levels. Interestingly, graduates who realized the importance of communication skills and teamwork to be good leaders also had higher job positions. Finally, general relevant features to predict job levels include the number of people directly in charge, company size, seniority, and satisfaction with income. © 2023 by the authors.",Computer Science,

This study is the first to evaluate the presence of IP among data science students and to evaluate several variables linked to IP simultaneously in a single study evaluating data science. In addition, it is the first study to evaluate the extent to which gender identification is linked to IP. We examined: (1) the degree to which IP exists in our sample; (2) how gender identification is linked to IP; (3) whether there are differences in goal orientation, domain identification, perfectionism, self-efficacy, anxiety, personal relevance, expectancy, and value for different levels of IP; and (4) the extent to which goal orientation, domain identification, perfectionism, self-efficacy, anxiety, personal relevance, expectancy, and value predict IP. We found that most students in the sample showed moderate and frequent levels of IP. Moreover, gender identification was positively related to IP for both males and females. Finally, results indicated significant differences in perfectionism, value, self-efficacy, anxiety, and avoidance goals by IP level and that perfectionism, self-efficacy, and anxiety were particularly noteworthy in predicting IP.

The authors apply clustering techniques from data science to identify groups of schools for which grading distributions were statistically similar in the internal medicine clerkship. Approach Grading systems (e.g., honors/pass/fail) and distributions (i.e., percent of students in each grade tier) were tabulated for the internal medicine clerkship at U.S. MD-granting medical schools by manually reviewing Medical Student Performance Evaluations (MSPEs) in the 2019 and 2020 residency application cycles. Grading distributions were analyzed using k-means cluster analysis, with the optimal number of clusters selected using model fit indices. Outcomes Among the 145 medical schools with available MSPE data, 64 distinct grading systems were reported. Among the 135 schools reporting a grading distribution, the median percent of students receiving the highest and lowest tier grade was 32% (range: 2%-66%) and 2% (range: 0%-91%), respectively. Four clusters was the most optimal solution (η2= 0.8): cluster 1 (45% [highest grade tier]-45% [middle tier]-10% [lowest tier], n = 64 [47%] schools), cluster 2 (25%-30%-45%, n = 40 [30%] schools), cluster 3 (20%-75%-5%, n = 25 [19%] schools), and cluster 4 (15%-25%-25%-25%-10%, n = 6 [4%] schools). The findings suggest internal medicine clerkship grading systems may be more comparable across institutions than previously thought. Next Steps The authors will prospectively review reported clerkship grading approaches across additional specialties and are conducting a mixed-methods analysis, incorporating a sequential explanatory model, to interview stakeholder groups on the use of the patterns identified. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Nevertheless, agile methodologies focus on contact with contracting customers and generating value for them. Usually, the communication between end users (they use the software and have low decision power) and the agile team is mediated by customers (they have high decision power but do not use the software). However, they do not know the actual problems that end users (may) face in their routine, and they may not be directly affected by software shortcomings. In this context, UX issues are typically identified only after the implementation, during user testing and validation. Objective: Aiming to improve the understanding and definition of the problem in agile projects, this research investigates the practices and difficulties experienced by agile teams during the development of data science and process automation projects. Also, we analyze the benefits and the teams’ perceptions regarding user participation in these projects. Method: We collected data from four agile teams, in the context of an academia and industry collaboration focusing on delivering data science and process automation solutions. Therefore, we applied a carefully designed questionnaire answered by developers, scrum masters, and UX designers. In total, 18 subjects answered the questionnaire. Results: From the results, we identify practices used by the teams to define and understand the problem and to represent the solution. The practices most often used are prototypes and meetings with stakeholders. Another practice that helped the team to understand the problem was using Lean Inception (LI) ideation workshops. Also, our results present some specific issues regarding data science projects. Conclusion: We observed that end-user participation can be critical to understanding and defining the problem. They help to define elements of the domain and barriers in the implementation. We identified a need for approaches that facilitate user-team communication in data science projects to understand the data and its value to the users’ routine. We also identified insights about the need of more detailed requirements representations to support the development of data science solutions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Computer Science,

This study also explores students' conceptual understanding of the unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm of K-means after being exposed to this method. The learning of DS methods and techniques has become paramount for the new generations of undergraduate engineering students. However, little is known about effective strategies to support student learning of DS and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The research questions are: How do students conceptualize their understanding of an unsupervised ML method after engaging with interactive visualizations designed using the computational cognitive apprenticeship approach? How do the affordances of the interactive visualizations support or hinder student knowledge integration of an unsupervised machine learning method? Design-based research allowed for the iterative design, implementation, and validation of the pedagogy in the context of a working classroom. For this, data collection methods often take the form of student artifacts. We performed a qualitative content analysis of students' written responses and reflections elicited during the learning process. Results suggest that the computational cognitive apprenticeship promoted knowledge integration. After interacting with the computational notebooks, most students had accurate conceptions of the goal and the nature of the method and identified factors affecting the output of the algorithm. Students found it useful to have a concrete representation of the method, which supported its conceptual understanding and showcased the acquisition of strategic knowledge for its appropriate execution. However, we also identified important misconceptions students held about the algorithm. © 2022 The Authors.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to reveal the reality of data science education in the Middle East and to determine the opportunities and challenges for teaching data science in the region. Thirteen countries in the Middle East were offering 48 data science programmes at the time of the study. The results reveal that these data science programmes significantly use the words ‘data’ and ‘analytics’ in their names. With regard to the academic affiliations of the data science programmes, the study found that they are offered in a variety of schools, especially computer science, information technology and business. Moreover, the study found that computer science is the dominant trend in the programmes. Data science programmes have a significant overlap with other programmes, especially statistics and computer science, because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field. Data science schools in the Middle East differ in terms of their programme titles, programme descriptions, course catalogues, curriculum structures and course objectives. Broadly, this study may be useful for those who are seeking to establish a data science programme or to strengthen data science curricula at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. © The Author(s) 2021.",Social Sciences,

In addition, recent data analysis techniques and the increasing availability of data have the potential to provide a deeper understanding of experimental data and simulation models. This work proposes a systematic, objective, and automatic methodology to validate and analyze experiments and models from a high-level perspective. The proposed methodology exploits the opportunities offered by the ‘data ecosystem’ concept, combining data and model evaluation and providing an integrated set of techniques to produce synthetic but comprehensive insights about the experiment and the predictive model. The methodology focuses on data assessment of the experiments used in the process, the use of a trend similarity comparison index to measure the model performance, and data science techniques to systematically extract models’ behavior insight by analyzing a large number of validation results and linking them to the experiment characteristics. The automated proposed approach follows the generality principle and can be extended to different application domains in which predictive models are validated against big data in the chemical engineering domain. As a case study, the proposed methodology is applied with hundreds of experimental datasets to evaluate a kinetic model that describes the pyrolysis and combustion of hydrocarbons. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Chemistry,

ABA is also recognised for its role in biotic defence, but there is currently a lack of consensus on whether it plays a positive or negative role. Here, we used supervised machine learning to analyse experimental observations on the defensive role of ABA to identify the most influential factors determining disease phenotypes. ABA concentration, plant age and pathogen lifestyle were identified as important modulators of defence behaviour in our computational predictions. We explored these predictions with new experiments in tomato, demonstrating that phenotypes after ABA treatment were indeed highly dependent on plant age and pathogen lifestyle. Integration of these new results into the statistical analysis refined the quantitative model of ABA influence, suggesting a framework for proposing and exploiting further research to make more progress on this complex question.

The framework outlines downstream responses known as key events, culminating in a clinically significant adverse outcome as a final result of the toxic exposure. Here we use the AOP framework combined with artificial intelligence methods to gain novel insights into genetic mechanisms that underlie toxicity-mediated adverse health outcomes. Specifically, we focus on liver cancer as a case study with diverse underlying mechanisms that are clinically significant. Our approach uses two complementary AI techniques: Generative modeling via automated machine learning and genetic algorithms, and graph machine learning. We used data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Adverse Outcome Pathway Database (AOP-DB; aopdb.epa.gov) and the UK Biobank's genetic data repository. We use the AOP-DB to extract disease-specific AOPs and build graph neural networks used in our final analyses. We use the UK Biobank to retrieve real-world genotype and phenotype data, where genotypes are based on single nucleotide polymorphism data extracted from the AOP-DB, and phenotypes are case/control cohorts for the disease of interest (liver cancer) corresponding to those adverse outcome pathways. We also use propensity score matching to appropriately sample based on important covariates (demographics, comorbidities, and social deprivation indices) and to balance the case and control populations in our machine language training/testing datasets. Finally, we describe a novel putative risk factor for LC that depends on genetic variation in both the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 11 (ABCB11) genes. © 2023",Computer Science,

Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a complex, dynamic condition associated with large amounts of clinical data and frequent decisions at the bedside. Novel data-driven technologies that can help screen, prompt, and support clinician decision-making could have a significant impact on patient outcomes. We sought to identify and summarize relevant evidence related to clinical informatics interventions in both PARDS and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for the second Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), and CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost). STUDY SELECTION: We included studies of pediatric or adult critically ill patients with or at risk of ARDS that examined automated screening tools, electronic algorithms, or clinical decision support systems. DATA EXTRACTION: Title/abstract review, full text review, and data extraction using a standardized data extraction form. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to identify and summarize evidence and develop recommendations. Twenty-six studies were identified for full text extraction to address the Patient/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome questions, and 14 were used for the recommendations/statements. Two clinical recommendations were generated, related to the use of electronic screening tools and automated monitoring of compliance with best practice guidelines. Two research statements were generated, related to the development of multicenter data collaborations and the design of generalizable algorithms and electronic tools. One policy statement was generated, related to the provision of material and human resources by healthcare organizations to empower clinicians to develop clinical informatics interventions to improve the care of patients with PARDS. CONCLUSIONS: We present two clinical recommendations and three statements (two research one policy) for the use of electronic algorithms and clinical informatics tools for patients with PARDS based on a systematic review of the literature and expert consensus.

Examining and reviewing every paper in an area in detail are time-consuming, making comprehensive reviews a challenging task. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms like topic models have become increasingly popular in recent years. Their ability to summarize large amounts of unstructured text into coherent themes or topics allows researchers in any field to keep an overview of state of the art by creating automated literature reviews. In this article, we apply topic modeling in the context of mathematics education and showcase the use of this data science approach for creating literature reviews by training a model of all papers (n = 336) that have been presented in Thematic Working Groups related to technology in the first eleven Congresses of the European Society for Research in Mathematics Education (CERME). We guide the reader through the stepwise process of training a model and give recommendations for best practices and decisions that are decisive for the success of such an approach to a literature review. We find that research in this period revolved around 25 distinct topics that can be grouped into four clusters: digital tools, teachers and their resources, technology experimentation, and a diverse cluster with a strong focus on student activity. Finally, a temporal analysis of these topics reveals a correlation between technology trends and research focus, allowing for reflection on future research in the field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Social Sciences,

The exact evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood function requires (Formula presented.) storage and (Formula presented.) operations, where (Formula presented.) is the number of geographical locations. Thus, exactly computing the log-likelihood function with a large number of locations requires exploiting the power of existing parallel computing hardware systems, such as shared-memory, possibly equipped with GPUs, and distributed-memory systems, to solve this exact computational complexity. In this article, we present ExaGeoStatR, a package for exascale geostatistics in R that supports a parallel computation of the exact maximum likelihood function on a wide variety of parallel architectures. Furthermore, the package allows scaling existing GP methods to a large spatial/temporal domain. Prohibitive exact solutions for large geostatistical problems become possible with ExaGeoStatR. Parallelization in ExaGeoStatR depends on breaking down the numerical linear algebra operations in the log-likelihood function into a set of tasks and rendering them for a task-based programming model. The package can be used directly through the R environment on parallel systems without the user needing any C, CUDA, or MPI knowledge. Currently, ExaGeoStatR supports several maximum likelihood computation variants such as exact, diagonal super tile and tile low-rank approximations, and mixed-precision. ExaGeoStatR also provides a tool to simulate large-scale synthetic datasets. These datasets can help assess different implementations of the maximum log-likelihood approximation methods. Herein, we show the implementation details of ExaGeoStatR, analyze its performance on various parallel architectures, and assess its accuracy using synthetic datasets with up to 250K observations. The experimental analysis covers the exact computation of ExaGeoStatR to demonstrate the parallel capabilities of the package. We provide a hands-on tutorial to analyze a sea surface temperature real dataset. The performance evaluation involves comparisons with the popular packages GeoR, fields, and bigGP for exact Gaussian likelihood evaluation.

Data science careers focus on collecting, organizing, and analyzing data to identify patterns and trends, which allows organizations to make informed decisions and develop effective solutions. Aim: to analyze the thematic specialization of institutions with academic programs in the area of data science. Methods: the Scopus database was used to conduct a bibliometric analysis aimed at examining the thematic specialization of institutions with academic programs in the field of data science. SciVal, a bibliometric analysis tool, was employed to extract the relevant data. The study period ranged from 2012 to 2021. Results: nine higher education institutions were found to offer undergraduate or graduate degrees in the field of data science. There was no correlation found between RSI and Field-Weighted Citation Impact (r=0,05355; P=0,8912; 95%CI:-0,6331 to 0,6930). Therefore, it cannot be claimed that specialization in the subject area studied influences the greater impact of research. On the other hand, recent accreditation did not influence greater specialization (r=0,1675; P=0,6667; 95%CI:-0,5588 to 0,7484). Additionally, no differences were found regarding academic level. Conclusions: the analysis of the thematic specialization of institutions with academic programs in the field of data science shows low scientific production in this field. Moreover, more than half of the analyzed higher education institutions have thematic specialization below the global average. This suggests that there is still a long way to go for these institutions to achieve adequate specialization and compete internationally in the field of data science. © Este es un artículo en acceso abierto.",Multidisciplinary,

In this regard, the World Health Organization has highlighted the scarce generation of knowledge that relates mortality from tumor diseases to environmental factors. Quantitative methods based on geospatial data science are used with cross-sectional information from the 2018 census; it’s found that the BCM in Colombia is not spatially randomly distributed, but follows cluster aggregation patterns. Under multivariate modeling methods, the research provides sufficient statistical evidence in terms of not rejecting the hypothesis that if a spatial unit has high FA and low CV, then it has significant advantages in terms of lower BCM.

There are many great teaching resources for learning technical skills. However, the analytical skills of understanding customer values, proposing causal relationships and gathering datasets are less common. This paper describes a new data science course designed to emphasize these analytical skills using individual project-based learning (PBL). PBL is considered to be a valuable teaching approach in computer science education. However, such courses typically have large-scale cohorts, resulting in PBL being used as group work. Our approach using individual PBL, circumvents issues concerning team dynamics and individual student assessment within group work. This course is designed to work for a large-scale (75 +) postgraduate cohort of both full- and part-time students. To facilitate the large-scale cohort the course makes use of a virtual learning environment (VLE) and recorded lectures. Students were able to choose the subject of their project and what software they would use to create visualizations. This paper provides details of a novel approach to teaching data science using individual PBL for a large-scale cohort while maintaining education quality. © 2023 ACM.",Computer Science,

We present an approach for doing so by harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we introduce Context-Aware Automated Feature Engineering (CAAFE), a feature engineering method for tabular datasets that utilizes an LLM to iteratively generate additional semantically meaningful features for tabular datasets based on the description of the dataset. The method produces both Python code for creating new features and explanations for the utility of the generated features. Despite being methodologically simple, CAAFE improves performance on 11 out of 14 datasets - boosting mean ROC AUC performance from 0.798 to 0.822 across all dataset - similar to the improvement achieved by using a random forest instead of logistic regression on our datasets. Furthermore, CAAFE is interpretable by providing a textual explanation for each generated feature. CAAFE paves the way for more extensive semi-automation in data science tasks and emphasizes the significance of context-aware solutions that can extend the scope of AutoML systems to semantic AutoML.

For instance, it serves as a vital mode of transportation to access their workplace, educational institutions or other activities. Any disruptions in bus schedules can lead to significant consequences, including missing meetings and other essential commitments for city residents. Thus, this paper presents a big data science and engineering solution for transit performance analytics in the area of transportation analysis. The insights derived from this data analysis are instrumental in enhancing the performance of public transportation, ultimately leading to an improved commuter experience in the city and contributing to the development of a smart city. To elaborate, our solution employs frequent pattern mining to identify variations in transit performance across different neighborhoods. By uncovering significant patterns, we establish connections that help us pinpoint the factors contributing to bus delays in specific areas. Improving the accuracy of bus arrival and departure times can significantly enhance the overall usability and appeal of public transit for commuters, as people are more likely to rely on buses when they are punctual and ensure timely arrivals at their destinations. Furthermore, our solution equips users with tools to visualize the insights gained from the analysis of bus departure times in various neighborhoods at different times of the day. The practicality of our big data science and engineering solution was demonstrated through an evaluation using real-life public transit data from a Canadian city, underscoring its potential to contribute to the development of a smart city. © 2023 IEEE.",Computer Science,

With the rising popularity of data science and interdisciplinary research, this paper aims to understand, examine and interpret the main concerns and emotions of people regarding the world's most top-rated airline, Qatar Airways by implementing sentiment analysis and topic modelling on Twitter data for extracting public sentiments and topics of discussion. We created a data set comprising of tweets for Qatar Airways. The approach starts with crawling tweets for a three-week time period, from 01 June 2023 to 21 June 2023, followed by pre-processing and lastly, implementing sentiment analysis and topic modeling. The analysis was carried out using RapidMiner and Orange. After removal of irrelevant tweets and applying sentiment analysis on a data set of 1305 tweets, 626 tweets were categorized into positive, 195 as negative and 484 as neutral sentiments. After analysis, public sentiment is found to be predominantly positive. Positive reviews were focused on good experience in business class, negative reviews were mostly concerned with baggage handling and neutral opinions were towards sponsorship by the airline.

Can data science truly serve the public interest? The question of our time is whether the promise of predictive science will exceed the inherent conflicts of interests presented by the organizations that fund it. As one of the first books on public interest technology, Ethical Data Science: Prediction in the Public Interest acknowledges the institutional incentives that drive computational prediction. It argues that data science prediction embeds administrative preferences that often ignore the disenfranchised. The book introduces the prediction supply chain to highlight moral questions alongside the interlocking legal and commercial interests dominating data science. Situating data-driven analysis within multiple layers of effort systematically exposes risky dependencies while also pinpointing opportunities for principled action, research ethics, and policy interventions. The prediction supply chain organizes critical thinking throughout the typical data science workflow, from gathering data through learning from insights. Data scientists can explore the full human potential of prediction by thinking like chefs, painters, historians, librarians, philosophers, and architects. Each stage draws on the arts and humanities as methods to empower broader conversations across multiple forms of expertise.

Additionally, this research provides a thorough connection of several DL strategies used in the Biomedical Sector (BS). A bright prospect in developing remedies to the complex problems in the BS, which stayed previously independent of the use of systematic strategies or mathematical modeling, is observed due to the emergence of prevailing computing devices, sophisticated DL techniques, and wide compilation of data from divergent tools of industry. Each specific inside the log data as well as each piece of data connected to the information being targeted might be included by DL methods. Despite their limitations, they continue to be unrestricted due to AS's restricting assumptions or NS's specialized data and/or energy computation demands. This thorough study can serve as a benchmark for DL solutions in this industry. Based on the analysis conducted, it has been found that DL techniques have a significant impact on addressing problems in the three main BS disciplines of forecasting, categorization, and segmentation. © 2023 IEEE.",Computer Science,

There is an increasing need for the identification of unusual occurrences in the traffic network due to the yearly growth in vehicle usage and the continual improvement of the traffic networking. Traffic anomaly detection provides sufficient decision-supporting information for road network operators, users, and other stakeholders. It is difficult to find anomalies in large-scale multivariate road traffic data. By bridging the gap between automated and manual traffic analysis methods, visual analytics helps increase process transparency. New rapid and effective processing tools and methodologies are required to swiftly extract and analyze data from the enormous volume of data. Data science approaches can be used to research and pinpoint various kinds of severe attacks and anomalies. Hence, Computational Data Science based detection of road traffic Anomalies is presented in this analysis. Thecomputational data science techniques (CDS) are needed to manage vast volumes of traffic data in a wide range of forms. Finding abnormalities in traffic data that impact traffic efficiency produced the development of computational data science.The primary advantage of the CDS approach is the early identification of data anomaly sources to avoid traffic congestion over a long-term. © 2023 IEEE.",Computer Science,

Context such as how the dataset was prepared and created, what source data were used, what code was used in processing, how the dataset evolved, and where it has been used and reused can provide much insight, but this information is often poorly documented. That is unfortunate since it makes datasets into black-boxes with potentially hidden characteristics that have downstream consequences. We argue that making dataset preparation more accessible and dataset usage easier to record and document would have significant benefits for the ML community: it would allow for greater diversity in datasets by inviting modification to published sources, simplify use of alternative datasets and, in doing so, make results more transparent and robust, while allowing for all contributions to be adequately credited. We present a platform, Renku, designed to support and encourage such sustainable development and use of data, datasets, and code, and we demonstrate its benefits through a few illustrative projects which span the spectrum from dataset creation to dataset consumption and showcasing. © 2023 Neural information processing systems foundation.

This huge mass of data, which provides many advantages if properly analyzed and managed, is vital for many systems. However, the healthy interpretation and correct management of this data, which is increasing day by day, has become complicated for many systems. One of the biggest reasons underlying this complexity is that most of the data produced in daily life are obtained from different devices and sources such as sensors, phones, tablets, and computers. It poses a fundamentally new set of research challenges, including structuring, sharing, and managing heterogeneous data from different sources in a common framework.

Part of that reasoning accumulated into statistics as a branch of mathematics, partly into the field of optimization and data mining and partly disbanded as a particular science. However, the data have a different point of view according to its understanding, conception, and application. This point of view states the data according to its interpretation. Understanding spread across various scientific fields—such as medicine and health, agriculture and production, engineering and industry, etc.—requires transformation into one general concept that is systematic and organized. Although the basic sciences and applied sciences grow according to their methodology and subjects, in reality, empirical science presents data as empirical evidence.
